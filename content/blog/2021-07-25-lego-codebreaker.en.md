If you're the owner of one of the following sets:

- [Porsche 911 GT3 RS ðŸ›’](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B01CCT2ZHC?tag=redken-21)
- [Lego Bugatti Chiron ðŸ›’](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B0792RB3B6?tag=redken-21)
- [Lego Lamborghini Sian FKP47 ðŸ›’](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B0813RJRYC?tag=redken-21)

You might have noticed that each car has a chassis piece with a code, that code, apart of the 'exclusive' set, means that you can redeem it on Lego website to get access to additional content like:

- mobile ringtones
- wallpapers
- certificate of ownership

In order to redeem them, get your car's detail:

- Porsche... inside the glove box
- Bugatti... inside the trunk
- Sian... inside the trunk

And go to the following URL's:

- Porsche: <https://www.lego.com/es-es/campaigns/technic/codebreaker>
- Bugatti: <https://www.lego.com/es-ar/campaigns/technic/bugatti-chiron/codebreaker>
- Sian <https://www.lego.com/en-us/campaigns/lamborghini-sian/owners-club>

Once your name and code is provided, you'll be redirected to a page with links to each one of the additional files

Enjoy!
