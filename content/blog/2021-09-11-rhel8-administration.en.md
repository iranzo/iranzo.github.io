After some time working on it (about 6 months for the main work and some more time for the reviews) with my colleagues Miguel and Scott, we've finally made it thanks to the support from our families and Packt, as well as several members of RH teams that gave the clearance to get it out!

The book targets users willing to learn skills to administer Red Hat Enterprise Linux or compatible systems. It is a hands-on guide to the administration and can be used as reference thanks to the real-life examples provided along the text.

It also features two chapters dedicated to exercises to check your knowledge acquired in the book.
