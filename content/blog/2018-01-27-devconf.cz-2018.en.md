## Presentation at DevConf.cz 2018!

As highlighted in the prior edition of the ['What's new']({{<ref "2018-01-16-recent-changes-in-magui-and-citellus.en.md">}}), we got a slot for DevConf.cz 2018.

During that [slot](https://devconfcz2018.sched.com/event/DJXG/detect-pitfalls-of-osp-deployments-with-citellus), my colleagues Martin, Pablo and myself were presenting on the history and basics of Citellus and how it helps on debugging issues and providing faster analysis of already known ones.

It is possible to watch the recording at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDzzqrUdn5A> and the slides used at:

Hope you enjoy it!
