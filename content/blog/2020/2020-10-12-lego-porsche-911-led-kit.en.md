As with other kits, I bought the Led kit for the [Porsche 911 GT3 RS ðŸ›’#ad](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B01CCT2ZHC?tag=redken-21) (more pics at [Porsche 911 GT3]({{<relref "2020-02-21-lego-bugatti-chiron-porsche-911-GT3-RS.en.md">}})) and just received my [LED Kit ðŸ›’#ad](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07C31ZFDM?tag=redken-21) (or [AliExpress ðŸ›’#ad](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_eKUAhL)) after my experience with the [Bugatti Chiron]({{<relref "2020-09-25-lego-bugatti-chiron-led-kit.en.md">}}) one.

Instructions were a photocopy which was hard to read, but seller provided electronic copy that was easier to understand.

The kit contains:

- LED for front lights (main lights)
- LED for rear lights (brake)
- LED for the ceiling (driver area)
- USB connector

Start installing them from the rear part, it will be easier to drive the wires trough the vehicle, it just comes with some bagged cables + pieces for each area listed above.

Check the results:
