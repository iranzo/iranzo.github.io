I got some pieces that were part of a [Lego Volkswagen T1 ðŸ›’](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B00PGZP8HE?tag=redken-21) but couldn't make for the complete set (which I already owned), so I was checking what mods I could build based on it, and best one, based on the amount of pieces was this one found on [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-46121/tobowski/caravan-camping-trailer-for-10220-t1-bus/).

As I found it to be a bit sad to leave the wheel, and some other elements outside I did some minor changes:

- Add a replacement wheel
- Expand the area for windows so that I can add more curtains
- Add a kitchen clock and smoke extractor
- Lift a bit the sink so that I could put the fold-able table there
- Put a sliding roof that can help to cover the area over the door
- Adding a rear bumper.

The pics bellow show the evolution from the original model in Rebrickable to the changes I've incorporated, hope you enjoy them!

I didn't have more pieces, but the sliding roof has a whole, so that I could replace the top area with the original 'elevating' roof, that will be reachable from the interior trough that hole
