Some pics about the 'almost' modular [Lego Ninjago City ðŸ›’](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B074XCNQSY?tag=redken-21).

Note that it's HUGE compared to other buildings and has lot of details. The water on the lower floor is defined by a set of bricks plus another set of transparent ones on top.

Some of the details:

- Has an elevator from the lower floor to the top restaurant
- hidden areas to store advertisements
- ATM for getting money
- hidden area for ninja suite
- etc.

Overall: one of the best sets I built.
