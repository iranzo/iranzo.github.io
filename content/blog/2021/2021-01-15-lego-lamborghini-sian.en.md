Xmas came with a good gift that I was able to finish mounting today, the [Lego Lamborghini Sian FKP47 ðŸ›’](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B0813RJRYC?tag=redken-21).

The build experience was good, except for some issues related with not building in the best conditions of light, but more or less fixable...

- I forgot to add a gear that required me to bend a bit the model to put it back
- Realized that the gear shift wasn't working because I didn't put the piece in the right direction, so it was being blocked between two options
- Pick the wrong piece at one step so later on it was missing for another

The biggest issue was that for the 2nd issue, I got into the motor drive had to be resettled and included some more dismantling, but nothing impossible.

Size is very similar to the [Porsche and Bugatti]({{<relref "2020-02-21-lego-bugatti-chiron-porsche-911-GT3-RS.en.md">}})) and had interesting build techniques for the frontal, the doors, etc.

Here you have some pictures of it:
