Today, as part of my confinement Lego catchup I was building the [Lego NASA Lunar Lander Apollo 11
ðŸ›’](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07G3WS3KV?tag=redken-21).

It covered the evening after work, and have some nice details. First bags are for the lunar surface and the remainder are for the module starting with the parts which are closer to the moon surface.

It includes lots of gold-colour plates and some stickers for the external side (flag, controls of the lunar module and some external surfaces).

The module has a dual door that opens close to the ladder and the module sides can be removed and placed again easily so that the astronauts can be put there or outside.

Also, the module has two opening closets, one for the camera used to record the astronaut going down the scale :)
