As always, I don't usually find myself keen to write about things I do, until I later realize they might be helpful for others, and that's why in the past I decided to switch the place I was putting the information about why did to Github and also, take benefit of practicing markdown for writing the entries.

At that time, I moved my old blog posts to markdown to be used in conjunction with Jekyll and to use OctoPress as the engine rendering the contents into a static website. The setup and migration was not difficult, but still require to use some ruby, while I was more familiar with Python.

Since some time ago, I was checking other platforms, following the same approach of rendering markdown files and sticker to Pelican, it's included in Fedora
repositories (python-pelican). Pelican offers a similar behavior, having also a server for allowing you to quickly test the new settings (plugins, themes, etc) and to publish the resulting website to a hosting provider.

As I did with Jekyll+OctoPress, I'm still using github.io for it, and I'm in the process of adapting some changes like additional plugins, theme tweaks and consider to develop one of my own.
