I loved the Bus and I was behind it for my city setup, so I went for it and got the [Lego 60335 Train station with bus](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B09RG1XMCT?tag=redken-21).

It contains three instruction manuals for the components:

- Cart for repairs that can run over the tracks or the road
- Bus
- Train station itself

The train station.

- It features a cafeteria with a croissant, coffee machine and another desk for the tickets.

- Has ticket machine and a place to sit while waiting for the train

- Features a road crossing with barriers using the new road plates

- Of course, it features an access ramp from the street to the train platform

The maintenance truck with the portable WC. The truck itself has a set of wheels that can be lowered so that it can move over the rails or bring them up so that it can drive in the road.
