After seeing this MOC [75894-mini-transporter](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-24636/Keep%20On%20Bricking/75894-mini-transporter/), I decided to:

- Buy the model [Lego 75894 - 1967 Mini Cooper S Rally and 2018 Mini John Cooper Works Buggy ðŸ›’](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07FNTMWMT?tag=redken-21)
- Buy the instructions at the MOC URL

After several times trying to pay for the instructions (which I was unable to get because
PayPal complained on the web site), I decided to make my own based on what I could see, and the result, are the images you can see, the initial model which had a small driving area and no minifig could sit there and the final one which added some more options like sizing cabin for allowing a minifigure to `drive`, plus some other alternatives for the front facing engine area and better holding of the rear wheels area.
