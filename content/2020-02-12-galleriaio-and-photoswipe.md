## Introduction

I was looking for an alternative for my (this) blog and hold pictures. I'm a
lego fan so I wanted to get some pictures uploaded but without bloating the
site.

In the article [Lego Mini Cooper
MOC]({filename}2019-06-09-lego-mini-cooper-moc.md) I did add lot of
pictures, same for [Lego Chinese dinner]({filename}2019-06-28-chinese-dinner.md)
and [Lego Dragon Dance]({filename}2019-06-28-dragon-dance.md).

I was checking and how telegram does handle some links and found that
Instragram 'links' get expanded to list the images inside directly to see if
that could help in a task I was helping at [Pelican-Elegant theme](https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant)
used at this site for creating a gallery.

## Instagram and multiple pictures

While doing some research, I found that apparently, to an instagram url you
can append `?__a=1` and it will 'dump' a `xml' of the picture or gallery,
like the following one for [this
picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/B7yh4IdItNd/):

<div class="elegant-instagram" data-instagram-id="B7yh4IdItNd"></div>

In this case, the generated JSON, available at <https://www.instagram.com/p/B7yh4IdItNd/?__a=1>
contains the information we required for getting image size, thumbnail, etc

The important there is that from a gallery ID, we can get a JSON without
requiring any API key (which is required for Flickr for example).

I'm not an expert in JavaScript, but I did something which was useful enough
to get the json, then process the internal code and separate in two cases,
'gallery ID' with one or multiple pictures.

Using it, I was able to then consider using some Gallery Software to get
them rendereded.

## Galleria.io

<https://galleria.io> offers a nice gallery, which uses jQuery and also
accepts a `json` as input, so it was more or less straighforward to convert
from the json from Instagram to what Galleria.io required.

I used that to get an intial draft to be added to Pelican-Elegant, but as
the goal in the project is to remove dependency on jQuery it was discarded.

However my personal research came part of another website that even not
directly from instagram, takes a good advantage of defining a json of images
for showcasing pictures.

## PhotoSwipe

While discussing about Galleria, Talha from Pelican-Elegant found two other
projects and it was decided that [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com/) provided nice features, mobile
usage like pinch-in and pinch-out.

Photoswipe required extra steps like creating a div and using html tags for
putting pics (check the [official documentation for Pelican-Elegant
Galleries](https://next.elegant.oncrashreboot.com/photoswipe-gallery-using-raw-html))

One of the main problems was getting image size required (Galleria.io didn't
required it), but when using Instagram pictures we can grab the information
from the JSON.

Finally with the help from Talha, we got it also working with Instagram
[Gallery Embed Instagram Post](https://next.elegant.oncrashreboot.com/gallery-embed-instagram-post)

Enjoy!
