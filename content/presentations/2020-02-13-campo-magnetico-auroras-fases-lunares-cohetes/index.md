## Introduction

- Magnetic field
  - Auroras
- Moon-Earth-Sun movement
  - Moon phases
  - Eclipses
- Rockets
- End

## Magnetic Field

Magnetic field surrounds us, but it's invisible although we can detect and
measure.

Easiest way to check it is to use a compass.

Note: Use magnets and compass

---

### 'See' the magnetic field

We can see it by using iron powder and magnets.

Note: Use magnets and iron powder

### Origin

- Earth has metal inside that moves and generates the magnetic field (pole)
- Earht is also very big and generates gravity field.

Note: Vulcanos spit that inner melted materials to the surface of Earth

---

### Solar storms, solar wind and flares

The Sun, sometines has storms and particles (debris) is launched towards earth and others with the `solar wind`.

Note: Analogy with water and storm

---

### Earth's shield

Magnetic field is Earth's shield against solar wind.

Note: Analogy with umbrella

---

### Auroras

Auroras are created when the solar wind arrives to earth

## Moon-Earth-Sun movement

Earth turns around the Sun and Moon around Earth.

Note: Use 3 kids for explaining the movement and 'eclipse' between them

---

## Moon phases

Depending on Moon position relative to Earth and Sun, it illuminates different fractions of it causing the phases we see:

- New Moon
- Crescent Moon
- Full Moon
- Waning moon

Note: When the moon is 'C'-shaped, it's in Waning phase.

---

## Moon Phases 2

---

## Eclipses

Sometimes, the Moon is between Earth and Sun

- Eclipses can be total or partial

---

## Eclipse 2

![](eclstart.jpg)

Note: Make a point on Moon round shape while it puts between Earth and Sun

---

## Eclipse 3

---

## Eclipse 4

---

## Rockets

Rockets fight againsts the other Earth: 'gravity'

Moon's gravity causes tides on Earth

---

## Escaping Earth

In order to escape Earth, speed must be very high (40.280 km/h).

Rockets are made in 'sections' that can be dropped to be lighter and use less energy to lift off.
