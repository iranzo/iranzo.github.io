### Who am I?

My name is Pablo and I've been working with opensource since before I started university.

Part of my evolution with opensource is described in this article [Linux]({filename}/2008-06-03-mi-Evolucion-con-Linux.markdown).

Since 2006 I work for Red Hat, where I started as Dedicated Enterprise Engineer (Onsite Consultant) for a contry-wide retail company headquarters in Valencia.

After two more years visitting the biggest customers in the country, I moved to the Technical Account Manager role, where I'm in charge of handling the relationship with some assigned Strategic Customers.

Shorty after my start as TAM, I started working with Cloud customers, providing support to their OpenStack deployments.
