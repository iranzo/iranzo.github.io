## Why?
When working on [Citellus]({filename}2017-07-26-Citellus-framework-for-detecting-known-issues.markdown) and [Magui]({filename}2017-07-31-Magui-for-analysis-of-issues-across-several-hosts.markdown) it soon became evident that Unit testing for validating the changes was a requirement.

Initially, using a Â´.travis.yml` file contained in the repo and the free service provided by <travis-ci.org> we soon got <github.com> repo providing information about if the builds succeded or not.

When it was decided to move to <gerrithub.io> to work in a more similar way to what is being done in upstream, we improved on the code comenting (peer review), but we lost the ability to run the tests in an automated way until the change was merged into github.

After some research, it became more or less evident that another tool, like Jenkins was required to automate the UT process and report to individual reviews about the status.

## Setup
Some initial steps are required for integration:

- Create ssh keypair for jenkins to use
- Creating github account to be used by jenkins and configuring above ssh keypair
- Login into gerrithub with that account
- Setup Jenkins and build jobs
- Allow on the parent project, access to jenkins github account permission to +1/-1 on Verify

In order to setup the Jenkins environment a new VM was spawned in one of our RHV servers.

This VM was installed with:
- 20 Gb of HDD
- 2 Gb of RAM
- 2 VCPU
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 'base install'

### Tuning the OS
RHEL7 provides a stable environment for run on, but at the same time we were lacking some of the latest tools we're using for the builds.

As a dirty hack, it was altered in what is not a recomended way, but helped to quickly check as proof of concept if it would work or not.

Once OS was installed, some commands (**do not run in production**) were used:

~~~bash
pip install pip # to upgrade pip
pip install -U tox # To upgrade to 2.x version

# Install python 3.5 on the system
yum -y install openssl-devel gcc
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.0/Python-3.5.0.tgz
tar xvzf Python-3.5-0.tgz
cd Python*
./configure

# This will install in alternate  folder in system not to replace user-wide python version
make altinstall

# this is required to later allow tox to find the command as 'jenkins' user
ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3.5 /usr/bin/
~~~

For the jenkins installation it's easier, there's a 'stable' repo for RHEL and the procedure is [documented](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Red+Hat+distributions):

~~~bash
wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
rpm --import https://jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key
yum install jenkins java
chkconfig jenkins on
service jenkins start
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
~~~

This will install and start jenkins and enable the firewall to access it.

If you can get to the url of your server at the port 8080, you'll be presented an initial procedure for installing Jenkins.

During it, you'll be asked for a password on a file on disk and you'll be prompted to create an user we'll be using from now on to configure.

Also, we'll be offered to deploy the most common set of plugins, choose that option, and later we'll add the gerrit plugin.

Once we can login into gerrit, we need to enter the administration area, and install new plugins and install [Gerrit Trigger](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Trigger).

Above link details how to do most of the setup, in this case, for gerrithub, we required:

- Hostname: **our hostname**
- Frontend URL: **https://review.gerrithub.io**
- SSH Port: **29418**
- Username: **our-github-jenkins-user**
- SSH keyfile: **path_to_private_sshkey**

Once done, click on `Test Connection` and validate if it worked.
