## Presentation at SuperSec 2018!

I've also got a slot at SuperSec 2018 (https://supersec.es/): Congress on secure software development, happening in Almer√≠a, Spain on the weekend on 12-13 May. 

Check the schedule at <https://supersec.es/programa/>

I'll be presenting on 13th may at 10:50, and the slide deck to be used is at <https://github.com/citellusorg/citellus/blob/master/doc/supersec2018-presentation-ES.md> and I'll be updating this once I get the recording URL.

Enjoy!
