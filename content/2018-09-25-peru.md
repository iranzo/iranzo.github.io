## Peru a repo syncer

Some projects upstream `bind` together lot of files which might not be of interest, but still the conveniency of a `git pull` to get latest updates, makes you to download the whole repo for just a bunch of files or folders.

For example, this website uses [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) to generate the webpages out of markdown files. Pelican does have a rich set of [plugins](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins) but all of them are in the same folder in the `git checkout`.

Here, is where `peru` comes in to play. Peru (hosted at <https://github.com/buildinspace/peru>) comes handy at this task.

You can install peru from pipsi:

```sh
pipsi install peru
```

And will provide you a commandline tool that uses a yaml file for definition of repositories, like the one I do use here:

```yaml
imports:
  # The dircolors file just goes at the root of our project.
  sitemap: plugins/
  better_codeblock_line_numbering: plugins/
  better_figures_and_images: plugins/
  yuicompressor: plugins/

git module sitemap:
  url: git@github.com:getpelican/pelican-plugins.git
  pick: sitemap
  rev: ead70548ce2c78ed999273e265e3ebe13b747d83

git module yuicompressor:
  url: git@github.com:getpelican/pelican-plugins.git
  pick: yuicompressor
  rev: ead70548ce2c78ed999273e265e3ebe13b747d83

git module better_figures_and_images:
  url: git@github.com:getpelican/pelican-plugins.git
  pick: better_figures_and_images
  rev: ead70548ce2c78ed999273e265e3ebe13b747d83

git module better_codeblock_line_numbering:
  url: git@github.com:getpelican/pelican-plugins.git
  pick: better_codeblock_line_numbering
  rev: ead70548ce2c78ed999273e265e3ebe13b747d83
```

In this way, `peru sync` will download from the provided repos the specified folder into the destination indicated, allowing you to integrate "other repo's files" in your own workflow.

For example, if you want to use citellus repo at one specific point in time, to be integrated in your code, you could use:

```yaml
imports:
  citellus: ./

git module citellus:
  url: git@github.com:citellusorg/citellus.git
  pick: citellusclient/plugins/
  rev: 1ee1c6a36f51e8a7c809d5162004fb57ee99b168
```

This will checkout citellus repo at one specific point in time and merge in your current folder.

Enjoy!
