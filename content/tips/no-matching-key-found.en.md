As you might have experienced... using a recent system to connect to a legacy one could be complicated as some insecure protocols have been disabled, with a message like:

```console
Unable to negotiate with 192.168.2.82 port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss
```

Create an entry like this in your `.ssh/config` file, so that insecure methods can be used to connect to a specific host:

```console
Host 192.168.2.82
	HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa
	KexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
  PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa
	User root
```

or alternatively on the command line:

```sh
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa root@192.168.2.8
```

```

```
