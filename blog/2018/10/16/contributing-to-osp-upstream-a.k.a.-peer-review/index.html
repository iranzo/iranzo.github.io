Infrastructure should be able to test it (for example you might need some specific hardware to test a card or network configuration) Environment should be sane so that prior runs doesn’t affect the validation. OSP CI can be checked at ‘Zuul’ http://zuul.openstack.org/ where you can ‘input’ the number for your review and see how the different bots are running CI tests on it or if it’s still queued.\nIf everything is OK, the bot will ‘vote’ your change as Verified +1 allowing others to see that it should not break anything based on the tests performed\nIn the case of OSP, there’s also third-party CI’s that can validate other changes by third party systems. For some of them, the votes are counting towards or against the proposed change, for others it’s just a comment to take into account.\nEven if sometimes you know that your code is right, there’s a failure because of the infrastructure, in those cases, writing a new comment saying recheck, will schedule a new CI test run.\nThis is common usually during busy periods when it’s harder for the scheduler to get available resources for the review validation. Also, sometimes there are errors in the configuration of CI that must be fixed in order to validate those changes.\nNote: you can run some of the tests on your system to validate faster if you’ve issues by running tox this will setup virtual environment for tests to be run so it’s easier to catch issues before upstream CI does (so it’s always a good idea to run tox even before submitting the review with git-review to detect early errors).\nThis is however not always possible as some changes include requirements like testing upgrades, full environment deployments, etc that cannot be done without the required preparation steps or even the infrastructure.\nCode Review+2 This is probably the ’longest’ process, it requires peers to be added as ‘reviewer’ (you can get an idea on the names based on other reviews submitted for the same component) or they will pick up new reviews as the pop un on notification channels or pending queues.\nOn this, you must prepare mentally for everything… developers could suggest to use a different approach, or highlight other problems or just do some small nit comments to fixes like formating, spacing, var naming, etc.\nAfter each comment/change suggested, repeat the workflow for submitting a new patchset, but make sure you’re using the same review id (that’s by keeping the commit id that is appended): this allows the Code Review platform to identify this change as an update to a prior one, and allow you for example to compare changes across versions, etc. (and also notify the prior reviewers of new changes).\nOnce reviewers are OK with your code, and with some ‘Core’ developers also agreeing, you’ll see some voting happening (-2..+2) meaning they like the change in its actual form or not.\nOnce you get Code Review +2 and with the prior Verified +1 you’re almost ready to get the change merged.\nWorkflow+1 Ok, last step is to have someone with Workflow permissions to give a +1, this will ‘seal’ the change saying that everything is ok (as it had CR+2 and Verified+1) and change is valid…\nThis vote will trigger another build by CI, and when finished, the change will be merged into the code upstream, congratulations!\nCannot merge, please rebase Sometimes, your change is doing changes on the same files that other programmers did on the code, so there’s no way to automatically ‘rebase’ the change, in this case the bad news is that you need to:\ngit checkout master # to change to master branch git pull # to push latest upstream changes git checkout yourbranch # to get back to your change branch git rebase master # to apply your changes on top of current master After this step, it might be required to manually fix the code to solve the conflicts and follow instructions given by git to mark them as reviewed.\nOnce it’s done, remember to do like with any patchset you submitted afterwards:\ngit commit --amend # to commit the new changes on the same commit Id you used git-review # to upload a new version of the patchset This will start over the progress, but will, once completed to get the change merged.\nHow do we do it with Citellus? In Citellus we’ve replicated more or less what we’ve upstream… even the use of tox.\nCitellus does use https://gerrithub.io (free service that hooks on github and allows to do PR)\nWe’ve setup a machine that runs Jenkins to do ‘CI’ on the tests we’ve defined (mostly for python wrapper and some tests) and what effectively does is to run tox, and also, we do use https://travis-ci.org free Tier to repeat the same on other platform.\ntox is a tool that allows to define several commands that are executed inside python virtual environments, so without touching your system libraries, it can get installed new ones or removed just for the boundaries of that test, helping into running:\npep8 (python formating compliance) py27 (python 2.7 environment test) py35 (python 3.5 environment test) The py* tests are just to validate the code can run on both base python versions, and what they do is to run the defined unit testing scripts under each interpreter to validate.\nFor local test, you can run tox and it will go trough the different tests defined and report status… if everything is ok, it should be possible that your new code review passes also CI.\nJenkins will do the +1 on verified and ‘core’ reviewers will give +2 and ‘merge’ the change once validated.
