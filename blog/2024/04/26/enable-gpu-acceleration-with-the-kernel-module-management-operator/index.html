Developer, the community to learn, code, and share faster. To read the original post, click here.\nCheck the video version for Red Hat TV\nIn this article we cover the required steps to configure Kernel Module Management Operator (KMM) and use it to deploy an out-of-tree (OOT) kernel module, as well as leveraging other related technologies to build a toolset for hardware enablement. To illustrate that process, we’ll leverage the Intel Data Center GPU Flex 140.\nWhat is the Kernel Module Management Operator? The Kernel Module Management Operator manages, builds, signs, and deploys out-of-tree (OOT) kernel modules and device plug-ins on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.\nBefore KMM, cluster admins had to manually install drivers to multiple nodes. Upgrades were painful and prone to errors from incompatible drivers. Furthermore, workloads might get scheduled to a node with broken drivers causing scheduling issues or missing hardware. KMM solves all of these problems, as we’ll see.\nKMM is designed to accommodate multiple kernel versions at once for any kernel module, allowing for seamless node upgrades and reduced application downtime. For more information, refer to the Kernel Module Management Operator product documentation.\nKMM is also a community project, which you can test on upstream Kubernetes, and there is a Slack community channel.\nPrerequisites For this scenario, we’ll require an already working OpenShift environment as we will use it to deploy the different tools on top. Check the documentation for instructions.\nKMM will require a registry to push images to. If you’ve installed on bare metal, ensure the internal registry is enabled and configured (refer to Installing a user-provisioned cluster on bare metal).\nAdditionally, this tutorial references data available from Intel at the following locations:\nIntel Data Center GPU Driver for OpenShift Intel Technology Enabling for OpenShift Set up Node Feature Discovery Operator Node Feature Discovery (NFD) detects hardware features available on nodes and advertises those features using nodes labels, so that they can later be used as selector for scheduling decisions.\nThe NFD Operator automatically adds labels to the nodes that present some characteristics, including if the node has a GPU and which GPU it has.\nIt’s an ideal way to identify which nodes require a kernel module to be enabled for the specific node(s) and later use it to instruct KMM to build it only for those.\nWe can install it via the following YAML:\n--- apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: openshift-nfd --- apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1 kind: OperatorGroup metadata: name: openshift-nfd namespace: openshift-nfd spec: targetNamespaces: - openshift-nfd --- apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1 kind: Subscription metadata: name: nfd namespace: openshift-nfd spec: channel: \"stable\" installPlanApproval: Automatic name: nfd source: redhat-operators sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace Once installed, we can create a CRD as described in the NFD Operator documentation to start.\nCreate a file named nfdcr.yaml with the following contents:\napiVersion: nfd.openshift.io/v1 kind: NodeFeatureDiscovery metadata: name: nfd-instance namespace: openshift-nfd spec: operand: image: quay.io/openshift/origin-node-feature-discovery:4.14 imagePullPolicy: Always servicePort: 12000 workerConfig: configData: | Then apply it with:\noc apply -f nfdcr.yaml Additionally, create a nodefeaturerule.yaml:\napiVersion: nfd.openshift.io/v1alpha1 kind: NodeFeatureRule metadata: name: intel-dp-devices spec: rules: - name: \"intel.gpu\" labels: \"intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu\": \"true\" matchFeatures: - feature: pci.device matchExpressions: vendor: { op: In, value: [\"8086\"] } class: { op: In, value: [\"0300\", \"0380\"] } And once it has been applied, oc describe node displays the labels applied. Below is a partial output of the labels that NFD applies:\nLabels: beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64 beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.ADX=true feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.AESNI=true feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.AMXINT8=true feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.AMXTILE=true feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.AVX=true feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.AVX2=true … As we can see, it starts showing some of the CPU flags among other values as labels in our system. We can then grep for Intel-specific GPU labels with:\n$ oc describe node rhvp-intel-01|grep intel.feature intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu=true …where we can see that NFD has detected the GPU.\nAt this point, NFD will take care of our node’s HW detection and labeling, which can later be used as node selectors for KMM to deploy the required modules.\nAdvanced node labeling For this use case, the Intel Data Center GPU Driver for OpenShift (i915) driver is only available and tested for some kernel versions.\nUsing NFD labels, we can target specific custom kernel versions for our module deployment and enablement so that only hosts with the required kernel and the required hardware are enabled for driver activation. This ensures that only compatible drivers are installed on nodes with a supported kernel, which is what makes KMM so valuable.\nIn this case, we’ll be using nodes that contain the intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu tag.\nLet’s move on to the next steps in our journey, installing KMM and building the kernel module with Driver Toolkit (DTK). DTK is a container image used as a base image where drivers can be built, as it includes kernel packages, some tools, etc.\nSet up Kernel Module Management Operator Install KMM using OperatorHub in our OpenShift Console or the following kmm.yaml:\n--- apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: openshift-kmm --- apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1 kind: OperatorGroup metadata: name: kernel-module-management namespace: openshift-kmm --- apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1 kind: Subscription metadata: name: kernel-module-management namespace: openshift-kmm spec: channel: \"stable\" installPlanApproval: Automatic name: kernel-module-management source: redhat-operators sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace With:\noc apply -f kmm.yaml Once it’s done, we can switch to the openshift-kmm project:\noc project openshift-kmm Create a kernel module As mentioned previously, KMM can perform the compilation and installation of kernel module drivers for our hardware.\nA kernel module can:\nHave dependencies Replace an existing driver Let’s explore the use cases in the next sections of this article.\nIntegration with NFD via CRDs KMM uses a kmod (kernel module) image to define which kernel modules to load, which is an OCI image that contains the .ko files.\nIn .spec.selector, we can define which nodes should be selected and as we showcased earlier, we can target one specific label added by NFD, so that only those nodes are targeted for loading the module for the hardware installed.\nKMM dependencies Adding a module might have additional module dependencies, that is, extra modules that need to be already loaded in the kernel.\nWe can use the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) field .spec.moduleLoader.container.modprobe.modulesLoadingOrder to identify the order for module loading starting with upmost module, then the module it depends on, and so on.\nReplace an in-tree module with an out-of-tree module Similar to dependencies, sometimes the module being loaded conflicts with an already loaded kernel module.\nIn this case, we need to have KMM first remove the conflicting module via the .spec.moduleLoader.container.inTreeModuleToRemove field of the CRD. KMM will then proceed and load the newer OOT module.\nFor the Intel Data Center GPU Flex series, the intel_vsec and i915 drivers will have to be removed which will be discussed later in this article.\nConfigure the Driver Toolkit for image building The Driver Toolkit) provides a base image with required kernel development packages that are used to build specific drivers for our platform, which match the kernel version used on each node where the accelerators exist.\nBy using a specially crafted Containerfile containing a reference to DTK_AUTO as shown below:\nARG DTK_AUTO FROM ${DTK_AUTO} RUN gcc \\... | The KMM Operator will replace the required variables as well as pull and build the image for the driver.\nAnd that’s all. Easy, right?\nManage heterogeneous nodes in the cluster As we’re using labels for selecting specific nodes in our cluster, we can keep a mix of nodes with or without the hardware in our cluster. KMM will take care of loading the required modules on the matching nodes, leaving the other ones without the specific accelerator.\nIn our case we’re using intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu=true as the label to match our intended nodes, leaving other nodes without the GPU affected.\nEnable the Intel Data Center GPU Flex 140 We’re going to explore the step-by-step the process for detecting, configuring, and enabling an Intel GPU in our OpenShift environment.\nOne of our workers has the accelerator installed, as reported by lspci | egrep 'Graphic|Display:\n02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ASPEED Technology, Inc. ASPEED Graphics Family (rev 52) a0:00.0 Display controller: Intel Corporation Data Center GPU Flex 140 (rev 05) Let’s create a MachineConfigPool (MCP) to apply the configuration in our environment:\napiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1 kind: MachineConfigPool metadata: name: intel-dgpu spec: machineConfigSelector: matchExpressions: - { key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role, operator: In, values: [worker, intel-dgpu, master], } nodeSelector: matchLabels: intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu: \"true\" Note\nIf you’re using single node OpenShift for this test, remember that the YAMLs must be adapted so that the configuration via MCO applies to the primary MCP; that is, using the selector machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master.\nUsing a machine configuration, we can define new parameters, like for example disable the built-in drivers with this YAML:\napiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1 kind: MachineConfig metadata: labels: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: intel-dgpu name: 100-intel-dgpu-machine-config-disable-i915 spec: config: ignition: version: 3.2.0 storage: files: - contents: source: data:,blacklist%20i915 mode: 0644 overwrite: true path: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-i915.conf - contents: source: data:,blacklist%20intel_vsec mode: 0644 overwrite: true path: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-intel-vsec.conf After this YAML is applied, we can check that there are no modules applied via oc debug node/rhvp-intel-01 (NOTE: if you see intel_vsec or i915 in the output, verify that the MachineConfig defined was correctly applied):\n$ lsmod|egrep 'i915|vsec' Now, we need to define the path to find the firmware for the module, and for this, there are two approaches; the first one is an MCO that patches the kernel command line (and will cause a reboot of the node) as configured with the following YAML:\napiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1 kind: MachineConfig metadata: labels: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master name: 100-alternative-fw-path-for-master-nodes spec: config: ignition: version: 3.2.0 kernelArguments: - firmware_class.path=/var/lib/firmware And for validating, we can check on the hosts via oc debug node/rhvp-intel-01 that the new parameter has been enabled:\n$ cat /proc/cmdline BOOT_IMAGE=(hd5,gpt3)/ostree/rhcos-085fdd39288474060c9d5bd7a88fabe8d218fcc960186712834c5e4ab319cb1d/vmlinuz-5.14.0-284.52.1.el9_2.x86_64 ignition.platform.id=metal ostree=/ostree/boot.0/rhcos/085fdd39288474060c9d5bd7a88fabe8d218fcc960186712834c5e4ab319cb1d/0 ip=ens801f0:dhcp,dhcp6 root=UUID=bf0c9edf-4aab-48a8-9549-5005fff7890e rw rootflags=prjquota boot=UUID=282ee60b-3053-4c2e-8f92-612af621e245 firmware_class.path=/var/lib/firmware systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1 cgroup_no_v1=all psi=1 The other approach is to patch the configuration for the KMM operator.\nAlternatively, we can modify the configmap by setting the path for the firmware which doesn’t cause a reboot, which is useful in single node OpenShift installations:\n$ oc patch configmap kmm-operator-manager-config -n openshift-kmm --type='json' -p='[{\"op\": \"add\", \"path\": \"/data/controller_config.yaml\", \"value\": \"healthProbeBindAddress: :8081\\nmetricsBindAddress: 127.0.0.1:8080\\nleaderElection:\\n enabled: true\\n resourceID: kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io\\nwebhook:\\n disableHTTP2: true\\n port: 9443\\nworker:\\n runAsUser: 0\\n seLinuxType: spc_t\\n setFirmwareClassPath: /var/lib/firmware\"}]' If you follow this approach, the KMM pod must be deleted so that the new configuration is taken into effect as soon as the operator recreates it, so that the systems get it applied during the loading of the modules.\nIntel Data Center GPU Flex 140 kernel module The Intel GPU kernel module deployment might be a bit tricky because it’s a driver and it has more ties to the specific kernel version being used that we’ll be setting in the commands for the build process, as we’ll see in the Containerfile used for the build.\nUsing prebuilt drivers In this approach, we use KMM to deploy the built and certified drivers already created by Intel which provides the container for each kernel version via a CI/CD pipeline. End users can directly consume that container via this Module definition:\napiVersion: kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: Module metadata: name: intel-dgpu namespace: openshift-kmm spec: moduleLoader: container: modprobe: moduleName: i915 firmwarePath: /firmware kernelMappings: - regexp: '^.*\\.x86_64$' containerImage: registry.connect.redhat.com/intel/intel-data-center-gpu-driver-container:2.2.0-$KERNEL_FULL_VERSION selector: intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu: \"true\" Compiling your own driver For the sake of demonstration, here we’ll be building our own driver image using in-cluster builds.\nFor building the kernel module, we can use the following Containerfile based on the upstream instructions that we’re already defining as configmap:\napiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: intel-dgpu-dockerfile-configmap namespace: openshift-kmm data: dockerfile: |- # Intel Data Center GPU driver components combinations.

Note the selector field. It has been modified to use NFD for discovery and only load the kernel module where needed.\nWe can check that the kernel module has been loaded by connecting to the node and checking the status:\nsh-5.1# lsmod|grep i915 i915 3977216 0 intel_vsec 20480 1 i915 compat 24576 2 intel_vsec,i915 video 61440 1 i915 drm_display_helper 172032 2 compat,i915 cec 61440 2 drm_display_helper,i915 i2c_algo_bit 16384 2 ast,i915 drm_kms_helper 192512 5 ast,drm_display_helper,i915 drm 581632 7 drm_kms_helper,compat,ast,drm_shmem_helper,drm_display_helper,i915 Alternatively, we can check the label added by KMM on the nodes:\n$ oc describe node |grep kmm kmm.node.kubernetes.io/openshift-kmm.intel-dgpu-on-premise.ready= Once the kernel module is deployed, use an application to verify HW acceleration is provided by the GPU.\nNote\nHere we’re directly using the /dev filesystem for accessing the GPU. The recommended way is to use the Intel Device Plugins Operator and then add a CR to expose gpu.intel.com/i915 to the kubelet for workload consumption as described in the repository.\nVerify the deployment Simple approach We’ll be using clinfo to get information from our card. To do so, we’ll create the image and the namespace and then run the utility inside a privileged pod similar to the application that we can use as a more complex approach.\nLet’s create the BuildConfiguration and ImageStream based on this one by creating a clinfobuild.yaml:\napiVersion: image.openshift.io/v1 kind: ImageStream metadata: name: intel-dgpu-clinfo namespace: openshift-kmm spec: {} --- apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1 kind: BuildConfig metadata: name: intel-dgpu-clinfo namespace: openshift-kmm spec: output: to: kind: ImageStreamTag name: intel-dgpu-clinfo:latest runPolicy: Serial source: dockerfile: \"ARG BUILDER=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9-minimal:latest \\nFROM ${BUILDER} \\n\\nARG OCL_ICD_VERSION=ocl-icd-2.2.13-4.el9.x86_64\\nARG CLINFO_VERSION=clinfo-3.0.21.02.21-4.el9.x86_64\\n\\nRUN microdnf install -y \\\\\\n glibc \\\\\\n yum-utils \\n\\n# install intel-opencl, ocl-icd and clinfo\\nRUN dnf install -y 'dnf-command(config-manager)' \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\\\\\n \\ dnf config-manager --add-repo https://repositories.intel.com/gpu/rhel/9.0/lts/2350/unified/intel-gpu-9.0.repo \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\\\\\n dnf install -y intel-opencl \\\\\\n https://mirror.stream.centos.org/9-stream/AppStream/x86_64/os/Packages/$OCL_ICD_VERSION.rpm \\ \\\\\\n https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/9/Everything/x86_64/Packages/c/$CLINFO_VERSION.rpm \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\\\\\n dnf clean all \u0026amp;\u0026amp; dnf autoremove \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm -rf /var/lib/dnf/lists/* \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\\\\\n \\ rm -rf /etc/yum.repos.d/intel-graphics.repo \\n\" type: Dockerfile strategy: dockerStrategy: buildArgs: - name: BUILDER value: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9-minimal:latest - name: OCL_ICD_VERSION value: ocl-icd-2.2.13-4.el9.x86_64 - name: CLINFO_VERSION value: clinfo-3.0.21.02.21-4.el9.x86_64 type: Docker triggers: - type: ConfigChange Let’s apply it with:\n$ oc create -f clinfobuild.yaml And then define the privileged pod that will run the tool with this pod defined by job.yaml:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: intel-dgpu-clinfo spec: containers: - name: clinfo-pod image: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift-kmm/intel-dgpu-clinfo:latest command: [\"clinfo\"] resources: securityContext: privileged: true runAsUser: 0 runAsGroup: 110 volumeMounts: - name: dev mountPath: /dev volumes: - name: dev hostPath: path: /dev Let’s create the pod with:\n$ oc create -f job.yaml And then examine the output of the pod by running:\n$ oc logs pod intel-dgpu-clinfo Number of platforms 1 Platform Name Intel(R) OpenCL HD Graphics Platform Vendor Intel(R) Corporation Platform Version OpenCL 3.0 Platform Profile FULL_PROFILE ... ...

Then, a volume creation with persistent storage (PVC) is registered so that the space is allocated and prepared for our application and a secondary one for the cache of the application.\nWe’ll use that space later on to download the Jupyter notebooks that we’ll be using for the GPU demonstration.\nFor the following items, apply each one with:\n$ oc apply -f \u0026lt;file.yaml\u0026gt; StorageClass Let’s create a file with the following contents defining our Storage Class named sc.yaml\nallowVolumeExpansion: true apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 kind: StorageClass metadata: name: lvms-vg1 parameters: csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: xfs topolvm.io/device-class: vg1 provisioner: topolvm.io reclaimPolicy: Delete volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer Persistent Volume Claim Similarly, we need to create a file for registering the storage that we’ll be naming pvc.yaml with the following contents:\napiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: pvc spec: storageClassName: lvms-vg1 accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 20Gi PVC for cache Finally, the application uses some cache, so another PVC will be created using a file named cache.yaml with the following contents:\napiVersion: v1 kind: PersistentVolumeClaim metadata: name: huggingface-cache spec: storageClassName: lvms-vg1 accessModes: - ReadWriteOnce resources: requests: storage: 20Gi Make sure you’ve applied the above files as instructed before following from this point.\nAt this point, we’ve created the Build, ImageStream, StorageClass, PVC, and PVC for Cache; because we launched the build, we will also have the ImageStream populated, so we’re ready to run the application.\nRunning the application A Jupyter notebook is an interactive workbook where commands, outputs like visualizations, etc., can be shown alongside the code.\nIt’s commonly used in data science analysis as it allows you to quickly edit and amend the commands and refresh the output with the new values.\nUsing the image generated in the previous Containerfile and the previous storage PVCs, we can create a pod with this YAML:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: kmm-demo-jupyter spec: containers: - name: kmm-demo-jupyter image: image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift-kmm/jupyter-demo args: # Password is paella in case you want to reuse - start-notebook.py - --PasswordIdentityProvider.hashed_password='argon2:$argon2id$v=19$m=10240,t=10,p=8$00Ynt8+Jk4sMtJUM+7Us5Q$ycb5PzmA7IH9yfOPAIfUjMNvDzXHKiMXPvM6+R5nucQ' env: - name: GRANT_SUDO value: \"yes\" - name: NB_GID value: \"110\" ports: - containerPort: 8888 hostPort: 8888 resources: limits: cpu: \"20\" memory: \"64Gi\" securityContext: privileged: true runAsUser: 0 runAsGroup: 110 volumeMounts: - name: dev mountPath: /dev - name: huggingface-cache mountPath: /home/jovyan/.cache/huggingface - name: work mountPath: /home/jovyan/work volumes: - name: dev hostPath: path: /dev - name: huggingface-cache persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: huggingface-cache - name: work persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: pvc Once the app is ready we can forward a local port (for example, to reach the application), but first we’ll prepare the examples we’ll be using with the Jupyter notebooks from the OpenVINO project by getting inside our pod with:\n$ oc rsh kmm-demo-jupyter …then, once we’re inside the pod:\n$ pwd /home/jovyan $ ls work $ git clone https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks chown -R jovyan:users openvino_notebooks Note\nIf you don’t specify an authentication method on the pod, a token will be printed on the pod logs, that should be used when reaching the Jupyter interface.\nUsing the following command, we’ll be forwarding a port from your computer to the pod itself so it will be easier to interact with the Jupyter notebook running there:\n$ oc port-forward kmm-demo-jupyter 8888:8888 Once done, on your local computer browser open http://localhost:8888 to access the notebook.\nIn the example above, the hashed password is paella, and it’s the one we’ll be using to access the Jupyter notebook.\nFrom within the browser, you can access the previous URL, navigate the notebooks, and select 225-stable-diffusion-text-to-image so that the final URL is:\nhttp://localhost:8888/lab/tree/openvino_notebooks/notebooks/225-stable-diffusion-text-to-image/225-stable-diffusion-text-to-image.ipynb\nSkip over the explanation steps and navigate to the area with the GPU selection drop-down (Figure 1).\nFigure 1: GPU selection dropdown\n…and later, the keyword section (Figure 2).\nFigure 2: keyword selection for imput\nIn this section, you can describe what kind of image should be generated. This is where the real magic happens. In this case, we will use the prompt Valencia fallas sunny day and see what kind of image is generated. See Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Output of the pipeline for the initial set of words Of course, you can go back, edit the input keywords, and try new ones (Figure 4)\nFigure 4: Output of the pipeline for the additional set of words\nWrap up We hope that you’ve enjoyed this read and realize how KMM, NFD, and DTK make managing custom drivers across many nodes across a cluster much easier than having to log into each node individually to install drivers.\nWe hope that you’ve enjoyed this read and realize how quick and convenient it is to use KMM, NFD, and DTK to enable support for accelerators in your OpenShift infrastructure.\nBut I do still want to upgrade my cluster! Don’t worry, KMM automatically will check the modules configured for your hosts and the kernel they are running—if you’re using the prebuilt images, KMM will download and enable the prebuilt image and if you’re using a custom build, a new build process will happen so that the new image is available… and using the labels added by KMM you can schedule your workloads on the nodes that have the driver ready for consumption.\nIt’s still recommended to do a staggered upgrade, so only a few nodes are updated before moving into others to avoid, for example, a new kernel having some issues with the build process or no prebuilt driver being available because it is still under the certification and validation process… rendering workloads requiring a specific device driver to become unschedulable.\nOnce you’ve checked that the driver is available at the preceding link and checked the official documentation on the OpenShift Upgrade process, be ready!\nEnjoy!

To illustrate that process, we&rsquo;ll leverage the <a href=https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230020/intel-data-center-gpu-flex-140/specifications.html>Intel Data Center GPU Flex 140</a>.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-kernel-module-management-operator>What is the Kernel Module Management Operator?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#what-is-the-kernel-module-management-operator>#</a></h2><p>The Kernel Module Management Operator manages, builds, signs, and deploys out-of-tree (OOT) kernel modules and device plug-ins on <a href=https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview>Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform</a> clusters.</p><p>Before KMM, cluster admins had to manually install drivers to multiple nodes. Upgrades were painful and prone to errors from incompatible drivers. Furthermore, workloads might get scheduled to a node with broken drivers causing scheduling issues or missing hardware. KMM solves all of these problems, as we&rsquo;ll see.</p><p>KMM is designed to accommodate multiple kernel versions at once for any kernel module, allowing for seamless node upgrades and reduced application downtime. For more information, refer to the <a href=https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/hardware_enablement/kmm-kernel-module-management.html>Kernel Module Management Operator product documentation</a>.</p><p>KMM is also a <a href=https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kernel-module-management>community project</a>, which you can test on upstream Kubernetes, and there is a <a href=https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C037RE58RED>Slack community channel</a>.</p><h2 id=prerequisites>Prerequisites<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#prerequisites>#</a></h2><p>For this scenario, we&rsquo;ll require an already working OpenShift environment as we will use it to deploy the different tools on top.
