This also opens the pandora box as it has lot of different approaches, depending on the function being used for doing the conversion, for example, some of them use frequency of elements, removing the less frequent, etc\nFinally, using the model the program can classify new data, based on the model that was elaborated, and in order to improve it, the data should be refreshed with new patterns for both cases: ham and spam so that it can continue evolving.\nThere are lot of documents about this, the shortest example I can think of is:\nfrom langdetect import detect from nltk.corpus import stopwords from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline import logging import nltk import os import pandas as pd import pickle import dill import string import sys logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) logger.debug(\"Downloading updated stopwords\") nltk.download(\"stopwords\") logger.debug(\"Starting training with on-disk databases\") message = pd.read_csv( \"spam/spam.%s.csv\" % language, sep=\",\", names=[\"Category\", \"Message\"] ) # Drop duplicate messages message.drop_duplicates(inplace=True) # Split the messages between train and test msg_train, msg_test, label_train, label_test = train_test_split( message[\"Message\"], message[\"Category\"], test_size=0.2 ) # Define the function for our language pipeline = Pipeline( [ ( \"bow\", CountVectorizer( analyzer=lambda text: process_text(text, language=languages[language]) ), ), (\"tfidf\", TfidfTransformer()), (\"classifier\", MultinomialNB()), ] ) logger.debug(\"Training the algorithm for language: %s\" % language) pipeline.fit(msg_train, label_train) # Evaluate the model on the training data set print(\"Testing the training for language: %s\" % language) pred = pipeline.predict(msg_train) logger.debug(\"Accuracy with train data\") logger.debug(\"%s\" % classification_report(label_train, pred)) logger.debug(\"Confusion Matrix:\\n%s\" % confusion_matrix(label_train, pred)) logger.debug(\"Accuracy: %s\" % accuracy_score(label_train, pred)) pred = pipeline.predict(msg_test) logger.debug(\"Accuracy with test data\") logger.debug(\"%s\" % classification_report(label_test, pred)) logger.debug(\"Confusion Matrix:\\n%s\" % confusion_matrix(label_test, pred)) accuracy = accuracy_score(label_test, pred) logger.debug(\"Accuracy: %s\" % accuracy) In short, this loads a know list of messages with spam and ham and divides it to train the model (via the pipeline) and later to test on the test data to check accuracy.\nFor doing so, it also downloads stopwords, which allows to remove junctions from phrases that are usually less meaningful of the message data itself. The process_text function defined in the pipeline is the one that we should write and takes care of removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.\nOf course, training takes a while so it’s not something you’ll be doing in realtime, but there is where the dill library (that worked better for my use case than pickle) helped me… Bot trains every day for new language model, stores it on disk, and later is able to restore from disk and directly use it.\nFor saving and restoring we can use something like this:\n# Save trained pipeline with open(pkl_filename, \"wb\") as file: dill.dump(pipeline, file) # Restore trained pipeline with open(pkl_filename, \"rb\") as file: pipeline = dill.load(file) So, here we’ve already all the pieces…\nWe can train a pipeline with our database of spam We can save and restore a pipeline so that we can do the hard work in easy moments and still have fast results when using it We can report messages as spam manually and perform actions The last piece of glue, was extending the /spam command to also store the message received and marked as spam into the database.\nWith this approach, the bot is able to work on the current existing database to generate a model, and still allow to grow the database with admin-reported spam messages. Those messages will then be used to train the pipeline periodically either as training or test, helping improving and enhancing the detection\nSo the actual behavior is that @redken_bot does:\nChecks new message if a model for that language exists (only saves it when accuracy is 85% or higher) If it’s spam, It will show a keyboard to either mark as spam (confirm) or ignore the message Admins can reply with /spam to messages, even if there’s no model for that language, helping in creating the database of messages If a message has been marked as spam, either by replying with /spam or by clicking on the button saying that it’s spam, the spam process begins: The button is always removed when replying (with the question about spam status) If the message was marked as spam, the original message is removed The user that sent the message, gets added to the database as spammer and then kicked out of the chat The message is stored on the database for future enhancement of the machine language detection. Additionally, I’m testing a ‘ham’ training feature, being fed with regular messages to start building a positive set of messages to compare with.\nI will continue searching for spam databases in other languages to do an initial set, but in the meantime, it will continue only with English.\nNext steps are:\nPromote messages marked as spam on groups into the general list (right now, messages marked as spam will be only stored, but no other work done with them) Once the message is promoted, it would be extracted from the database and put in an external CSV file similar to the SMS collection for the relevant language for future training. Use the list of blocked UID with status global, to warn in groups where that user is in, showing the chance to kick the user. spamcheck set to auto, automatically deletes the spam messages and reports the user, together with previous item, it will also auto-kick users Enjoy and happy filtering!\n","wordCount":"1514","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://iranzo.io/mugshot.png","datePublished":"2021-06-24T22:00:00+02:00","dateModified":"2023-08-25T09:46:05.162Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Pablo Iranzo Gómez"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://iranzo.io/blog/2021/06/24/redken-machine-learning-for-spam-detection/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Pablo Iranzo Gómez blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://iranzo.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://iranzo.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://iranzo.io/apple-icon-152x152.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In short, this loads a know list of messages with spam and ham and divides it to train the model (via the pipeline) and later to test on the test data to check accuracy.</p><p>For doing so, it also downloads <code>stopwords</code>, which allows to remove junctions from phrases that are usually less meaningful of the message data itself. The <code>process_text</code> function defined in the pipeline is the one that we should write and takes care of removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.</p><p>Of course, training takes a while so it&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;ll be doing in realtime, but there is where the <code>dill</code> library (that worked better for my use case than <code>pickle</code>) helped me&mldr; Bot trains every day for new language model, stores it on disk, and later is able to restore from disk and directly use it.</p><p>For saving and restoring we can use something like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-py data-lang=py><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e># Save trained pipeline</span>
