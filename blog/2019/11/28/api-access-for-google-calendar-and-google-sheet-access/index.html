Please, read gspread documentation on requisites and steps for obtaining this file.\nOnce the file is there, the code can be as easy as:\nimport os import gspread from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials # use creds to create a client to interact with the Google Drive API scope = [ \"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds\", \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\", ] creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name( os.environ[\"GACREDENTIALS\"], scope ) client = gspread.authorize(creds) # Find a workbook by name and open the first sheet # Make sure you use the right name here. sheet = client.open(\"My spreadsheet\").sheet1 # Extract and print all of the values records = sheet.get_all_records() for record in records: if record[\"name\"] != \"\": dosomething() In this case, we access the file via the file pointed in GACREDENTIALS environment variable and use the scope for defining the access level we need for this file.\nIn this case, the spreadsheet was shared with ‘viewer’ permissions to the system account created for the credentials and stored in the file on disk.\nThis enabled us to iterate over the elements and parse the rows in the sheet for doing or ‘ICS’ dump to file, using specific column for each item (start date, end date, description, location, name, etc)\nThe generated ICS file could be stored in an accessible Webserver for subscribing to it, or we could manually import the events into our calendar.\nThis solution, however, created duplicates of entries on each import, as the walk process just recreated all the entries on each execution.\nAs a next-step, it was considered to directly write them to Google calendar so that the file itself could be created and stored but the actual event check happening via regular calendaring app.\nAccessing Google Calendar Access to Google calendar required to setup another method for accessing via using the standard Google API for Python. This required to setup credentials for OAUTH app, with a ‘portal’ to grant access to a user, which writes a token to disk that can later be used for accessing the service.\nAs we’re reading always from the same Google Sheet, we wanted to first cleanup the older entries, so we used the following code (taken from: https://karenapp.io/articles/2019/07/how-to-automate-google-calendar-with-python-using-the-calendar-api/):\nimport os import os.path import pickle import sys import dateutil.parser import gspread from google.auth.transport.requests import Request from googleapiclient.discovery import build from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials # If modifying these scopes, delete the file token.pickle. SCOPES = [\"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar\"] credpickle = os.environ[\"GApickle\"] # Calendar to write to mycalendarid = \"mycalendarID received when listing available calendars\" def get_calendar_service(): \"\"\" Gets calendar service handler :return: services handler \"\"\" creds = None # The file token.pickle stores the user's access and refresh tokens, and is # created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first # time. if os.path.exists(credpickle): with open(credpickle, \"rb\") as token: creds = pickle.load(token) # If there are no (valid) credentials available, FAIL! if not creds or not creds.valid: if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token: creds.refresh(Request()) else: print(\"Error, create a new pickle file for continuing\") sys.exit(1) # Save the credentials for the next run with open(\"token.pickle\", \"wb\") as token: pickle.dump(creds, token) service = build(\"calendar\", \"v3\", credentials=creds) return service We also wrote a function for writing new events to the calendar:\ndef writeevent(service, summary, location, start, end, description): \"\"\" Writes event to Gcal :param service: service handler :param summary: summary of event :param location: location of event :param start: start date :param end: end date :param description: Description of event \"\"\" event_result = ( service.events() .insert( calendarId=mycalendarid, body={ \"summary\": summary, \"location\": location, \"start\": { \"date\": start.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\"), \"timeZone\": \"Europe/Madrid\", }, \"end\": { \"date\": end.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\"), \"timeZone\": \"Europe/Madrid\", }, \"description\": description, }, ) .execute() ) print(\"Event: %s written\" % summary) And the main code:\ndef main(): \"\"\" Main code for the program \"\"\" # Cleanup Gcalendar service = get_calendar_service() # Call the Calendar API events_result = service.events().list(calendarId=mycalendarid).execute() events = events_result.get(\"items\", []) # Delete all the events for event in events: try: print(\"Deleting event: %s\" % event[\"summary\"]) service.events().delete( calendarId=mycalendarid, eventId=event[\"id\"] ).execute() except googleapiclient.errors.HttpError: print(\"Failed to delete event\") # Create events # Connect to Gspreadsheet to get events # use creds to create a client to interact with the Google Drive API scope = [ \"https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds\", \"https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\", ] creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name( os.environ[\"GACREDENTIALS\"], scope ) client = gspread.authorize(creds) # Find a workbook by name and open the first sheet # Make sure you use the right name here. sheet = client.open(\"KNI conferences pipeline\").sheet1 # Extract and print all of the values records = sheet.get_all_records() # Iterate records for valid events and create them for record in records: if record[\"Name\"] != \"\": # Main event start = record[\"Starts\"] end = record[\"Ends\"] startdate = False enddate = False if start != \"\": startdate = dateutil.parser.parse(start) if end != \"\": enddate = dateutil.parser.parse(end) if startdate and enddate: writeevent( service, summary=record[\"Conference\"], location=record[\"Location\"], start=startdate, end=enddate, description=record[\"Event URL\"], ) if __name__ == \"__main__\": main() Wrap up The final code, is able to use both API’s to get access to the spreadsheet, read the rows, and in parallel use the API to nuke the calendar, by removing all events and then, recreating them with the data obtained from the spreadsheet.\nThere’s of course room for optimization, like just updating events if it’s changing or not, but that would make code more complex and not adding much more functionality (as still calls would be needed for querying event, comparing, and then updating as needed).\nNote\nIf you wonder about why using environment variables for the credential files used… this jobs runs inside Jenkins instance that has the defined secrets exported in the Jenkinsfile as environment variables, allowing to ‘secure’ a bit more the access to the credentials itself (even if those have been scope-limited to only allow not harmful usage.)\nEnjoy!
