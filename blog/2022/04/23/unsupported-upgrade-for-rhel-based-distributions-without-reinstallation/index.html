The new version, that was released at around 18 months later contained so many changes that it was hard to test the upgrades themselves until leapp was introduced.\nCheck the lifecycle here: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata\nHowever, the biggest problem could be the incompatibility of packages or package formats… but as usually there were some middle layers it was possible to upgrade without reinstallation by performing some manual steps.\nWarning\nThis procedure is completely unsupported, it should not be used on production systems and doesn’t ensure service availability during the upgrade. Or even system availability once finished…\nIn the past, the method that could be used, was to provide the upgradeany parameter to anaconda installer via the command line options, but this still required to boot from an ISO (or physical media) to perform the upgrade, and have little chance of recovery in case of any failure during the installation as anaconda environment was very limited in recovery options.\nIn brief:\nWe’ll move in unsupported ways from one release to another Package dependencies will require removing some packages or forcing installations ignoring dependencies that might cause issues At some point, if a power cut happens, the system might not be recoverable as it will be missing important parts. There could be leftovers in the system This will be a lengthy, process and prone to failure Upgrade the systems always before you reach to this situation, this is not something you want to do on regular basis because product has reached End-Of-Life (EOL) It should be easier to work on automating deployments and configurations so in the future you can redeploy on newer releases or newer hardware and get a track of all the performed configurations, etc, ideally on a control version system for traceability. Downloading files from older servers might be difficult, or even connecting to them, because of now obsoleted SSL or other crypto libraries. Don’t do this unless you want to fully risk the system you had For each release, try to download .0 and .latest versions, we will use .0 when upgrading from prior major, and before moving to next major version, we’ll update to the latest minor… in this way we might catch some errors of packages not upgraded or procedures… like kernel scripts that might install on the .0 but end up in an unbootable system, moving from .0 to .latest will allows us to reduce the chances of hitting this kind of issues. Preparation steps In order to start, it is safe to perform some steps:\nPerform a backup and prepare for reinstallation Ensure there’s enough free disk Get a copy of the install media on the system we’re going to update and have it at hand in case we need to recover Use tmux1 or screen as screen multiplexers so that we can recover in case of network connectivity issues Ensure that tools like wget are installed Have access to remote console, either via BMC or the virtualization platform if that’s the case. Check the documentation for the next release to see what are the breaking changes included in the release notes for each version, this will give us some hints about packages that we were using and are no longer available in our system. Upgrade the system To have a smoother experience, first step is to fully update the system to the latest version of the packages\n# EL5 onwards yum update --skip-broken Once we made sure that no further updates are available we’re ready for the next steps.\nDownload the install media to the system As indicated in the previous section, we need to download the install media to the system, this will make sure that we’ll have available a copy we can use without requiring network access to install whatever is needed in our host.\nWe’ll mount it to /mnt and create a repository file for using it in each release step. For mounting, we’ll execute:\nmount -o loop /root/rhel${VERSION}.iso /mnt Attempting the update The package managers yum and dnf include a flag that might be really useful as long as we’ve compatible repositories or we’ve made available our ISO install media on our system and created a custom repo definition for it.\nWe’ll follow this procedure on a RHEL base system, starting with RHEL 4.8 until RHEL 9 Beta.\nLet’s get ready on the environment…\nRHEL 4.8 installation Proceed to install RHEL 4.8 via the ISO on the system so that we’ve the test-bed ready for our procedure. Note\nAs you might have experienced… using a recent system to connect to a legacy one could be complicated as some insecure protocols have been disabled.\nCreate an entry like this in your .ssh/config file, so that insecure methods can be used to connect:\nHost 192.168.2.82 HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa KexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa User root or alternatively on the command line:\nssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa root@192.168.2.8 RHEL 4.8 used up2date as method for connecting to RHN, however, as it is out of the support cycle I wouldn’t expect to get RHN working for it.\nAt that time, CentOS had the chance to create repositories and copy over the yum command so that it could be used on it, but let’s try to use what we’ve in the system… first of all, we need to load the RHEL ISO image into our system.\nAs we don’t have access to RHN, let’s loopback mount the ISO image and let’s install screen:\n[root@rhel-instance mnt]# mount /root/rhel4.8.iso /mnt [root@rhel-instance mnt]# cd /mnt [root@rhel-instance mnt]# rpm -Uvh RedHat/RPMS/screen-4.0.2-5.x86_64.rpm Preparing... ########################################### [100%] 1:screen ########################################### [100%] [root@rhel-instance mnt]# From this point, we should execute screen and continue working from within that shell\nWe can now cd into our user home folder and umount /mnt to start the process.\nRHEL 4.8 to RHEL 5.x upgrade First, let’s mount RHEL 5.x CD-ROM on /mnt and let’s start over…\nIn RHEL5, we used to have the main OS packages in the Server/ folder so let’s cd into it via cd /mnt/Server.\nIf you’re familiar with rpm the first attempt would be to use rpm -Fvh *.rpm to freshen all the packages, that is, install the updated versions and carry on… but we’ll get into a dependency hell, and if you attempt it, lot of the installed packages might have been already removed, and not be possible to upgrade…\nTo make our life easier, we need to do whatever we can to get yum and rpm packages updated to RHEL 5 versions, so that we can later use yum for the dependency resolution.\nNow, we begin a loop of package additions and removals to get to some state we can move forward…\nWhen we first attempt to update rpm, yum, etc. we begging requiring python and upgrading it will complain about some of the system-config-lvm or system-config-network… so the procedure is a try-and-error approach:\nrpm -e system-config-lvm rpm -e system-config-network rpm -e system-config-packages rpm -e gnome-python2-bonobo gnome-python2 gnome-python2-canvas And then start attempting to upgrade yum and rpm while you get into dependency hell like this:\nSo… we realized it is a pain, so let’s grab some ‘CentOS’ packages from the CentOS 4.9 VAULT that we can use to get yum working:\npython-elementtree-1.2.6-5.el4.centos.x86_64.rpm python-sqlite-1.1.7-1.2.1.x86_64.rpm python-urlgrabber-2.9.8-2.noarch.rpm sqlite-3.3.6-2.x86_64.rpm yum-2.4.3-4.el4.centos.noarch.rpm yum-metadata-parser-1.0-8.el4.centos.x86_64.rpm Let’s copy them to our system (in case we haven’t downloaded them there) and let’s install them… using --nodeps as the packages require yumconf that we will not find as a built package:\n# Disable SELinux Enforcing setenforce 0 # Preferably, configure SElinux to be in permissive mode via editing the /etc/selinux/config file and setting it to 'SELINUX=permissive' # Install the packages for yum rpm -Uvh --nodeps python-elementtree-1.2.6-5.el4.centos.x86_64.rpm python-sqlite-1.1.7-1.2.1.x86_64.rpm python-urlgrabber-2.9.8-2.noarch.rpm sqlite-3.3.6-2.x86_64.rpm yum-2.4.3-4.el4.centos.noarch.rpm yum-metadata-parser-1.0-8.el4.centos.x86_64.rpm Now, let’s create a repo file at /etc/yum.repos.d/cdrom.repo with the following contents:\n[cdrom] name=CDROM baseurl=file:///mnt/Server/ enabled=1 gpgcheck=0 From this point, we could use yum to install packages…\nFirst packages to upgrade should be… again… yum and rpm and it will start several dependency loop checks that we’ll need to resolve… but in a lot easier way than having to manually specify the packages to upgrade.\nAs we’re on a server, let’s remove some more packages to get this progressing:\nrpm -e pcmcia-cs pm-utils bluez-utils rpm -e xorg-x11-xfs chkfontpath urw-fonts rpm -e kudzu system-config-mouse system-config-network-tui system-config-soundcard --nodeps rpm -e autofs libgnomeui up2date Now, let’s update some packages:\nyum update hwdata --\u003e Restarting Dependency Resolution with new changes. --\u003e Populating transaction set with selected packages.

First packages updated using yum!!\nNow, we’re hitting several issues with kernel being incompatible… so let’s remove it but just from the database (as well as other packages):\nrpm -e kernel --nodeps --justdb --noscripts rpm -e python-elementtree util-linux yum initscripts glib2 procps --justdb --noscripts rpm -e system-config-securitylevel After those steps… that again… are critical we can start updating some more packages:\nyum -y install yum hal initscripts After it finishes, we can try again to update yum:\n[root@rhel-instance ~]# yum install yum There was a problem importing one of the Python modules required to run yum. The error leading to this problem was: No module named urlgrabber Please install a package which provides this module, or verify that the module is installed correctly.

python-numeric-23.7-2.2.2.el5_6.1.x86_64.rpm pygobject2-2.12.1-5.el5.x86_64.rpm And let’s attempt freshen of all the remaining packages:\nrpm -Fvh *.rpm # Let's also install createrepo... we'll need it later rpm -ivh createrepo*.rpm After this… only a few packages are missing to upgrade, yum is still not working as it complains with some problems with the rpm database, so we need to continue with rpm:\nrpm -Uvh kexec-tools-1.102pre-165.el5.x86_64.rpm busybox-1.2.0-14.el5.x86_64.rpm mesa-libGL-6.5.1-7.11.el5_9.x86_64.rpm libdrm-2.0.2-1.1.x86_64.rpm rpm -Uvh mlocate-0.15-1.el5.2.x86_64.rpm redhat-release-notes-5Server-52.x86_64.rpm tzdata-2014e-1.el5.x86_64.rpm Here, yum now reports that no packages are missing to update… so let’s attempt to reboot the system and cross fingers..\nIf the system rebooted, make sure it shows the right kernel for EL5… 2.6.9 is a bad value… it should read 2.6.18… if you’re in that case, once the system boots, mount the CD-ROM again, and force kernel reinstallation via:\nrpm -ivh --force /mnt/Server/kernel-2.6.18-398.el5.x86_64.rpm And reboot again.\nRHEL5 to RHEL6 upgrade Wow, now we’re on RHEL5, yum is already native in this version, so that we can update the cdrom.repo file to point to the root of the mount point instead of the Server folder, then run yum update and… BAM!, incompatible hash for the repository…\nAs we installed createrepo before we can cd into our home folder and run:\n[root@localhost ~]# cd [root@localhost ~]# mkdir el6 [root@localhost ~]# for file in /mnt/Packages/*.rpm; do ln -s $file . ;done [root@localhost ~]# createrepo -o el6 -u file:///mnt/Packages/ /mnt/Packages/ 3861/3861 - zsh-4.3.11-8.el6.x86_64.rpm Saving Primary metadata Saving file lists metadata Saving other metadata Once this is done, we need to update our cdrom.repo file to point to the location file:///root/el6 ;-)\nLet’s start again… removing some packages:\nyum remove system-config-* kudzu rhnlib python-numeric rhpl avahi ipsec-tools OpenIPMI authconfig yum remove xorg-x11-server-utils xorg-x11-server-Xorg xorg-x11-utils xorg-x11-fonts-base xorg-x11-fonts-Type1 openjade rpm -e sudo-1.6.7p5-30.1.5.x86_64 --justdb # (as

uname -a |grep x86_64 \u0026\u0026 yum remove *.i{3,4,5,6}86 Ok, so we’re back on having issues with rpm features that we don’t have at EL5… so we need to update rpm and required components so that we can continue installing newer packages.\nThis approach brings us to the egg-chicken issue… we can’t install the packages because our installed version is old, and until we update them, we can’t install the other updates… and even cpio is older than the version used, so we might need to use an intermediate machine to uncompress the rpm related packages copy them over, and use them to install the updates on the system itself.\nWe need to prepare and uncompress the following files from the install media on a newer machine\nPACKAGES=\"db4-4.7.25-16.el6.x86_64.rpm glibc-2.12-1.7.el6.x86_64.rpm glibc-common-2.12-1.7.el6.x86_64.rpm glibc-utils-2.12-1.7.el6.x86_64.rpm libcap-2.16-5.2.el6.x86_64.rpm lua-5.1.4-4.1.el6.x86_64.rpm popt-1.13-7.el6.x86_64.rpm rpm-4.8.0-12.el6.x86_64.rpm rpm-build-4.8.0-12.el6.x86_64.rpm rpm-libs-4.8.0-12.el6.x86_64.rpm rpm-python-4.8.0-12.el6.x86_64.rpm xz-libs-4.999.9-0.3.beta.20091007git.el6.x86_64.rpm\" for package in $PACKAGES;do echo \"Uncompressing $package\" rpm2cpio /mnt/Packages/$package | cpio -idmv done Once the process has finished, you’ll get a list of folders that need to be copied back to the host… note, this will overwrite libraries, binaries and can render your system unusable.\nOnce that step is done… your system should have RPM version 4.8.0 and you can use it to install and force install several set of packages… until you can get yum working again…\nIn this case, yum provided in EL6, features the distro-sync command, which is a simple way to update the system to the latest available packages in our local repository.\nYum might complain of some missing packages.. ensure to get yum packages installed, as well as expat, SSL and some other dependencies that will complain.\nOnce YUM is working and distro-sync has finished, we need to edit the cdrom.repo to act against the folder with the packages (so that it has the group information), perform a yum clean and then yum groupinstall base so that all the missing packages from a base system are installed.. resolving conflicts like the redhat-release-notes etc by manually removing and then adding the new versions of the files.\nEnsure also to remove all packages named .el5. from our system… we should be on el6 now…\nAnd our system is ready for next step!\nRHEL6 to RHEL7 upgrade Well, we got until this point, so we’re back into the versions that are ‘supported’ under the ELS.\nLet’s follow the standard approach to register our system and attach to a pool:\nyum -y install subscription-manager subscription-manager register subscription-manager attach pool=XXXXXXX Then, let’s add extra repositories we might require:\nsubscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-extras-rpms subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms # And then, let's install preupgrade tools yum install preupgrade-assistant preupgrade-assistant-el6toel7 redhat-upgrade-tool Check for the next steps in the
