MiniDLNA provides an opensource DLNA server software that can index and present specific folders on your computer to DLNA clients on your network.

Project at sourceforge is distributed as CVS code that you need to checkout and compile for it to work on your computer.

I've setup a spec file that will allow you to create an rpm that has been tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 machine x86 for easing adoption among users.

Enjoy it
Pablo
