A few days ago, I was checking a friend's system for backing up.<br /><br />It was based on rsync on the linux side and rsync server on a windows machine he uses for storing  information generated by other software.<br /><br />Rsync worked pretty well for him until he started to put several strange characters in filenames which rendered the backup unusable to certain point.<br /><br />After being asked for alternative backup software that was available on several platforms, I've ended testing duplicity.<br /><br />As a command line interface tool, it can run pretty well on cron jobs, and eases the management of doing full or incremental backups to several kinds of targets.<br /><br />Duplicity can also take care of tiding backup store removing older backups and automatically perform a full backup if older than x time, so you can automate the full backup management.<br /><br />Best of all is the backend support, as you can do backups over rsync, scp, ftp, file, imap, ssh, amazon, webdav, etc , so you can use that old NAS to store your backups without any special support except pretty standard protocols even on low-end models.
