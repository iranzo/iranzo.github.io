[{"content":"As we introduced in RHEL Bootable Containers, we can use Image-Mode in RHEL to build system images that we can write to disk.\nFirst step towards having a minimal system, of course, is minimization and it can touch different approaches and methods, depending on how aggressive space reclaim we want to achieve.\nWarning\nPlease note that many of the listed methods below are making changes to a system that could make it harder to debug, be aware that removing files installed from packages will lead to package integrity verification, and, although it might not affect the system, will have to be accounted in case of integrity verification.\nUsual suspects On a regular RHEL system we usually target several paths:\nInstallation customization Custom partitioning to efficiently use the space Reduced package set Remove extra dependencies Post installation customization Adjust number of kernels to keep installed Remove leftover files Configure system logging to rotate and compress logs Remove unneeded locales Remove unused documentation (/usr/share/doc, /usr/share/man/, etc.) Enforcement of above change: Custom RPM\u0026rsquo;s with %post scripts that for each upgrade in other packages, reapply the cleanup performed on docs, etc Ansible playbook execution This of course it\u0026rsquo;s only targeting on the disk requirements, but if we also target for low RAM use we need to play with additional items:\nReduce running services Stop unused daemons Tune requirements: we might want a Graphical User Interface, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be GNOME and can use something lighter or even something locked down to just allow running some applications. Disable autostart of daemons on hotplug of devices Use static networking to disable NetworkManager, etc. Where we do leverage Anaconda\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Minimal install\u0026rsquo; as starting point:\nYou can learn about this on this article published on Red Hat Developer: Minimizing RHEL for Edge and IOT deployment.\nContainers How is this achieved when we\u0026rsquo;re using containers?\nFor containers there are also other concepts involved, as containers are made up with different filesystem layers that sit on top of each other, and for example, one layer might add a file that is removed at a later point, using disk space which, in the end, will be freed (but the container will have it referenced inside).\nFor containers the recommendation is to reduce the number of layers to avoid this, but on the other side, having atomic layers allows us to reuse already existing ones, so when we\u0026rsquo;re downloading an updated container, all the layers that we had downloaded, are reused and only new ones are added.\nSome tools allow to compact the container layers, reclaiming the space that was used and later freed, but this is against the reutilization of layers mentioned above, so they might require additional download for the modified layers\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll speak about this and leveraging FAB tool for assembling bootable containers in the next article.\nEnjoy!

To read the original post, click here.\nCheck the video version for Red Hat TV\nIn this article we cover the required steps to configure Kernel Module Management Operator (KMM) and use it to deploy an out-of-tree (OOT) kernel module, as well as leveraging other related technologies to build a toolset for hardware enablement. To illustrate that process, we\u0026rsquo;ll leverage the Intel Data Center GPU Flex 140.\nWhat is the Kernel Module Management Operator? The Kernel Module Management Operator manages, builds, signs, and deploys out-of-tree (OOT) kernel modules and device plug-ins on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform clusters.\nBefore KMM, cluster admins had to manually install drivers to multiple nodes. Upgrades were painful and prone to errors from incompatible drivers. Furthermore, workloads might get scheduled to a node with broken drivers causing scheduling issues or missing hardware. KMM solves all of these problems, as we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nKMM is designed to accommodate multiple kernel versions at once for any kernel module, allowing for seamless node upgrades and reduced application downtime. For more information, refer to the Kernel Module Management Operator product documentation.\nKMM is also a community project, which you can test on upstream Kubernetes, and there is a Slack community channel.\nPrerequisites For this scenario, we\u0026rsquo;ll require an already working OpenShift environment as we will use it to deploy the different tools on top. Check the documentation for instructions.\nKMM will require a registry to push images to. If you\u0026rsquo;ve installed on bare metal, ensure the internal registry is enabled and configured (refer to Installing a user-provisioned cluster on bare metal).\nAdditionally, this tutorial references data available from Intel at the following locations:\nIntel Data Center GPU Driver for OpenShift Intel Technology Enabling for OpenShift Set up Node Feature Discovery Operator Node Feature Discovery (NFD) detects hardware features available on nodes and advertises those features using nodes labels, so that they can later be used as selector for scheduling decisions.\nThe NFD Operator automatically adds labels to the nodes that present some characteristics, including if the node has a GPU and which GPU it has.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an ideal way to identify which nodes require a kernel module to be enabled for the specific node(s) and later use it to instruct KMM to build it only for those.\nWe can install it via the following YAML:\n--- apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: openshift-nfd --- apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1 kind: OperatorGroup metadata: name: openshift-nfd namespace: openshift-nfd spec: targetNamespaces: - openshift-nfd --- apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1 kind: Subscription metadata: name: nfd namespace: openshift-nfd spec: channel: \u0026#34;stable\u0026#34; installPlanApproval: Automatic name: nfd source: redhat-operators sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace Once installed, we can create a CRD as described in the NFD Operator documentation to start.\nCreate a file named nfdcr.yaml with the following contents:\napiVersion: nfd.openshift.io/v1 kind: NodeFeatureDiscovery metadata: name: nfd-instance namespace: openshift-nfd spec: operand: image: quay.io/openshift/origin-node-feature-discovery:4.14 imagePullPolicy: Always servicePort: 12000 workerConfig: configData: | Then apply it with:\noc apply -f nfdcr.yaml Additionally, create a nodefeaturerule.yaml:\napiVersion: nfd.openshift.io/v1alpha1 kind: NodeFeatureRule metadata: name: intel-dp-devices spec: rules: - name: \u0026#34;intel.gpu\u0026#34; labels: \u0026#34;intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; matchFeatures: - feature: pci.device matchExpressions: vendor: { op: In, value: [\u0026#34;8086\u0026#34;] } class: { op: In, value: [\u0026#34;0300\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0380\u0026#34;] } And once it has been applied, oc describe node displays the labels applied. Below is a partial output of the labels that NFD applies:\nLabels: beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64 beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.ADX=true feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.AESNI=true feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.AMXINT8=true feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.AMXTILE=true feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.AVX=true feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.AVX2=true … As we can see, it starts showing some of the CPU flags among other values as labels in our system. We can then grep for Intel-specific GPU labels with:\n$ oc describe node rhvp-intel-01|grep intel.feature intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu=true \u0026hellip;where we can see that NFD has detected the GPU.\nAt this point, NFD will take care of our node\u0026rsquo;s HW detection and labeling, which can later be used as node selectors for KMM to deploy the required modules.\nAdvanced node labeling For this use case, the Intel Data Center GPU Driver for OpenShift (i915) driver is only available and tested for some kernel versions.\nUsing NFD labels, we can target specific custom kernel versions for our module deployment and enablement so that only hosts with the required kernel and the required hardware are enabled for driver activation. This ensures that only compatible drivers are installed on nodes with a supported kernel, which is what makes KMM so valuable.\nIn this case, we\u0026rsquo;ll be using nodes that contain the intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu tag.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s move on to the next steps in our journey, installing KMM and building the kernel module with Driver Toolkit (DTK). DTK is a container image used as a base image where drivers can be built, as it includes kernel packages, some tools, etc.\nSet up Kernel Module Management Operator Install KMM using OperatorHub in our OpenShift Console or the following kmm.yaml:\n--- apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: openshift-kmm --- apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1 kind: OperatorGroup metadata: name: kernel-module-management namespace: openshift-kmm --- apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1 kind: Subscription metadata: name: kernel-module-management namespace: openshift-kmm spec: channel: \u0026#34;stable\u0026#34; installPlanApproval: Automatic name: kernel-module-management source: redhat-operators sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace With:\noc apply -f kmm.yaml Once it\u0026rsquo;s done, we can switch to the openshift-kmm project:\noc project openshift-kmm Create a kernel module As mentioned previously, KMM can perform the compilation and installation of kernel module drivers for our hardware.\nA kernel module can:\nHave dependencies Replace an existing driver Let\u0026rsquo;s explore the use cases in the next sections of this article.\nIntegration with NFD via CRDs KMM uses a kmod (kernel module) image to define which kernel modules to load, which is an OCI image that contains the .ko files.\nIn .spec.selector, we can define which nodes should be selected and as we showcased earlier, we can target one specific label added by NFD, so that only those nodes are targeted for loading the module for the hardware installed.\nKMM dependencies Adding a module might have additional module dependencies, that is, extra modules that need to be already loaded in the kernel.\nWe can use the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) field .spec.moduleLoader.container.modprobe.modulesLoadingOrder to identify the order for module loading starting with upmost module, then the module it depends on, and so on.\nReplace an in-tree module with an out-of-tree module Similar to dependencies, sometimes the module being loaded conflicts with an already loaded kernel module.\nIn this case, we need to have KMM first remove the conflicting module via the .spec.moduleLoader.container.inTreeModuleToRemove field of the CRD. KMM will then proceed and load the newer OOT module.\nFor the Intel Data Center GPU Flex series, the intel_vsec and i915 drivers will have to be removed which will be discussed later in this article.\nConfigure the Driver Toolkit for image building The Driver Toolkit) provides a base image with required kernel development packages that are used to build specific drivers for our platform, which match the kernel version used on each node where the accelerators exist.\nBy using a specially crafted Containerfile containing a reference to DTK_AUTO as shown below:\nARG DTK_AUTO FROM ${DTK_AUTO} RUN gcc \\... | The KMM Operator will replace the required variables as well as pull and build the image for the driver.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s all. Easy, right?\nManage heterogeneous nodes in the cluster As we\u0026rsquo;re using labels for selecting specific nodes in our cluster, we can keep a mix of nodes with or without the hardware in our cluster. KMM will take care of loading the required modules on the matching nodes, leaving the other ones without the specific accelerator.\nIn our case we\u0026rsquo;re using intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu=true as the label to match our intended nodes, leaving other nodes without the GPU affected.\nEnable the Intel Data Center GPU Flex 140 We\u0026rsquo;re going to explore the step-by-step the process for detecting, configuring, and enabling an Intel GPU in our OpenShift environment.\nOne of our workers has the accelerator installed, as reported by lspci | egrep 'Graphic|Display:\n02:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ASPEED Technology, Inc. ASPEED Graphics Family (rev 52) a0:00.0 Display controller: Intel Corporation Data Center GPU Flex 140 (rev 05) Let\u0026rsquo;s create a MachineConfigPool (MCP) to apply the configuration in our environment:\napiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1 kind: MachineConfigPool metadata: name: intel-dgpu spec: machineConfigSelector: matchExpressions: - { key: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role, operator: In, values: [worker, intel-dgpu, master], } nodeSelector: matchLabels: intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; Note\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using single node OpenShift for this test, remember that the YAMLs must be adapted so that the configuration via MCO applies to the primary MCP; that is, using the selector machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master.\nUsing a machine configuration, we can define new parameters, like for example disable the built-in drivers with this YAML:\napiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1 kind: MachineConfig metadata: labels: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: intel-dgpu name: 100-intel-dgpu-machine-config-disable-i915 spec: config: ignition: version: 3.2.0 storage: files: - contents: source: data:,blacklist%20i915 mode: 0644 overwrite: true path: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-i915.conf - contents: source: data:,blacklist%20intel_vsec mode: 0644 overwrite: true path: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-intel-vsec.conf After this YAML is applied, we can check that there are no modules applied via oc debug node/rhvp-intel-01 (NOTE: if you see intel_vsec or i915 in the output, verify that the MachineConfig defined was correctly applied):\n$ lsmod|egrep \u0026#39;i915|vsec\u0026#39; Now, we need to define the path to find the firmware for the module, and for this, there are two approaches; the first one is an MCO that patches the kernel command line (and will cause a reboot of the node) as configured with the following YAML:\napiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1 kind: MachineConfig metadata: labels: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master name: 100-alternative-fw-path-for-master-nodes spec: config: ignition: version: 3.2.0 kernelArguments: - firmware_class.path=/var/lib/firmware And for validating, we can check on the hosts via oc debug node/rhvp-intel-01 that the new parameter has been enabled:\n$ cat /proc/cmdline BOOT_IMAGE=(hd5,gpt3)/ostree/rhcos-085fdd39288474060c9d5bd7a88fabe8d218fcc960186712834c5e4ab319cb1d/vmlinuz-5.14.0-284.52.1.el9_2.x86_64 ignition.platform.id=metal ostree=/ostree/boot.0/rhcos/085fdd39288474060c9d5bd7a88fabe8d218fcc960186712834c5e4ab319cb1d/0 ip=ens801f0:dhcp,dhcp6 root=UUID=bf0c9edf-4aab-48a8-9549-5005fff7890e rw rootflags=prjquota boot=UUID=282ee60b-3053-4c2e-8f92-612af621e245 firmware_class.path=/var/lib/firmware systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1 cgroup_no_v1=all psi=1 The other approach is to patch the configuration for the KMM operator.\nAlternatively, we can modify the configmap by setting the path for the firmware which doesn\u0026rsquo;t cause a reboot, which is useful in single node OpenShift installations:\n$ oc patch configmap kmm-operator-manager-config -n openshift-kmm --type=\u0026#39;json\u0026#39; -p=\u0026#39;[{\u0026#34;op\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;add\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/data/controller_config.yaml\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;healthProbeBindAddress: :8081\\nmetricsBindAddress: 127.0.0.1:8080\\nleaderElection:\\n enabled: true\\n resourceID: kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io\\nwebhook:\\n disableHTTP2: true\\n port: 9443\\nworker:\\n runAsUser: 0\\n seLinuxType: spc_t\\n setFirmwareClassPath: /var/lib/firmware\u0026#34;}]\u0026#39; If you follow this approach, the KMM pod must be deleted so that the new configuration is taken into effect as soon as the operator recreates it, so that the systems get it applied during the loading of the modules.\nIntel Data Center GPU Flex 140 kernel module The Intel GPU kernel module deployment might be a bit tricky because it\u0026rsquo;s a driver and it has more ties to the specific kernel version being used that we\u0026rsquo;ll be setting in the commands for the build process, as we\u0026rsquo;ll see in the Containerfile used for the build.\nUsing prebuilt drivers In this approach, we use KMM to deploy the built and certified drivers already created by Intel which provides the container for each kernel version via a CI/CD pipeline. End users can directly consume that container via this Module definition:\napiVersion: kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io/v1beta1 kind: Module metadata: name: intel-dgpu namespace: openshift-kmm spec: moduleLoader: container: modprobe: moduleName: i915 firmwarePath: /firmware kernelMappings: - regexp: \u0026#39;^.*\\.x86_64$\u0026#39; containerImage: registry.connect.redhat.com/intel/intel-data-center-gpu-driver-container:2.2.0-$KERNEL_FULL_VERSION selector: intel.feature.node.kubernetes.io/gpu: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; Compiling your own driver For the sake of demonstration, here we\u0026rsquo;ll be building our own driver image using in-cluster builds.\nFor building the kernel module, we can use the following Containerfile based on the upstream instructions that we\u0026rsquo;re already defining as configmap:\napiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: intel-dgpu-dockerfile-configmap namespace: openshift-kmm data: dockerfile: |- # Intel Data Center GPU driver components combinations.

Don\u0026rsquo;t create channels or public groups It will make it harder to provide access via the link, but it\u0026rsquo;s not that hard to create a QR or share with some parents so that they can share between them, but in the other hand, no external members, nor internet search engines, etc. will be able to find them (and will not be able to see the content without joining).\nWhen a channel or group is public, without being a member, messages can be seen as well as group members, etc.\nDo not forward messages When you forward a message, depending on the configuration from the person who sent the initial message, their name and even a link to their profile to start a conversation can be shared\u0026hellip; for example, your partner records a video that you want send to the group, and when you forward it to your group\u0026hellip; people in the group can click on message forward from and end up sending messages to your partner, to another teacher, etc.\nInstead, download the content, then re-upload it to the group.\nUse invitation links with limit of users or expiration date When you create an invitation link to a group or channel, by default, the link is valid forever:\nClick on Create a new link and setup some limits:\nFor example, for a school group, it might make sense to make it valid for joining for 1 or 2 months, and being used maximum by 50 users (2 parents/kid), so, in this way, we can avoid that if the join link gets exposed, many people could join the group with unwanted users.\nIf you think that a link has been exposed, using the \u0026lsquo;3 dots\u0026rsquo; menu, you can cancel it, remove it, so that no one else could use until a new one is created.\nValidate group members As you\u0026rsquo;ve the phones of the parents from the data they filled, add them to your agenda, add the name of the parent, the kid, so that when you check the list of members you can find out names that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there.\nUse pinned messages It\u0026rsquo;s very easy to send loads of information, together with pictures, material to bring for arts\u0026amp;crafts, etc\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s good to make use of pineed messages (one or more) with general information or relevant for a period like:\nMeeting days and schedule Time table Official center communication channels Official calendar (bank holidays, etc.) Library or other services information. Rules for behaviour And others, that can be pinned when it\u0026rsquo;s needed to bring materials, an authorization for a trip, etc\u0026hellip; in this way, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to \u0026lsquo;browse\u0026rsquo; between important ones, while other stuff stays in between in the message flow.\nSet groups and channels to be time bound If a group is used during one school year, once it finishes, it makes sense to keep it for a little longer to allow parents to download materials, pictures as a memory or even to share the link for the new group for the next school year\u0026hellip; but after some period (for example another year)\u0026hellip; delete the group/channel\u0026hellip; leaving them forever will not be very useful unless you want to reuse materials, and, in that case, better to keep it in another group for \u0026lsquo;archival\u0026rsquo; purposes.\nSend a reminder (and set it as pinned) explaining when the group will be removed and once again in one month before that day.\nAutomatic deletion In the same line, you can establish in the channels that messages are deleted automatically, allowing this cleanup to happen by itself:\nPeriod of time:\nOnce it\u0026rsquo;s enabled, it appears indicated in the lower part when sending new messages:\nIn this case, it\u0026rsquo;s set for 1d (1 day).\nChats or groups instead of channels If for whatever reason (I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend), you want to create a chat where users could participate, consider seriously to enable the \u0026lsquo;anonymous\u0026rsquo; permission: In this way, even if you\u0026rsquo;re in the group with everyone else, whenever you write, the group name will appear instead of yours, blocking in that way that people could contact you directly via private messages but still interact via the group.\nAs a user they\u0026rsquo;ll see:\nWhen you write, they\u0026rsquo;ll see:\nBut you\u0026rsquo;ll still be able to see everyone:\nSo, in this way, you can participate, provide information, etc. but without being contacted on your personal contact.\n1 to 1 messages Within telegram you can also send private messages and get answers in private without sharing your phone number.\nOnly if you add the contact and choose to share number the other person will be able to see it and call you outside the Telegram application.\nThink about hiding members list If anyone can see members of groups, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to have users receiving spam\u0026hellip; a way to avoid it is to make that only administrators can see the members list.\nPictures in low and high resolution When a picture is sent, sending them compressed is nice to see them, but for keeping those as memories, it\u0026rsquo;s better to send them in full size as \u0026lsquo;file\u0026rsquo;\u0026hellip; many times it\u0026rsquo;s sad not to be able to keep those memories in full resolution as, by default, those are sent reduced.\nOnce uploaded in high resolution you can even remove them from your phone, as they\u0026rsquo;ll be available in the channel and you can download them if is ever needed.\nUse scheduled messages Telegram allows to write messages and program the date/hour those are being sent:\nOnce selected, choose the moment:\nThis allows us to, whenever we\u0026rsquo;ve the time, program a message or messages with reminders (materials, trips, special activities, etc.) without depending on writing them on that very same moment those are happening, giving us a lot more flexibility for information delivery planning and when it\u0026rsquo;s going to better to send it:\nHave a little period of time and sending 20 messages in that moment will just cause confusion and make some messages to be unseen by recipients. Using that time to schedule messages at the best timing for each one, will make them that recipients will pay attention to each message and the information is not lost between other messages. Use text instead of images If you add text when you\u0026rsquo;re adding an image, you can use later the search function to locate it, but if you just put images\u0026hellip; you\u0026rsquo;ll have to check one by one to find the information. You can combine both and put the picture with the caption to get best of both options!\nUse polls Telegram allows you to create polls to ask about information/feedback based on the vote responses\u0026hellip; take an advantage out of it!\nUse a calendar for publishing events If you\u0026rsquo;ve read Showing calendar events in Telegram you\u0026rsquo;ll know that you can use bots that will take care of publishing events in channels or groups\u0026hellip; take an advantage so that in the same moment you manage your agenda, you can plan events that could be interesting for families.\n","permalink":"https://iranzo.io/blog/2024/01/05/advice-for-telegram-usage-in-education/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTelegram is being used frequently at schools for allowing an easy communication flow using the \u0026lsquo;channels\u0026rsquo;, where teachers can send information to families without sharing their personal contact details so that they can\u0026rsquo;t be contacted outside of the official tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis comfort, came, probably because of not knowing the problems/dangers that were not taken into consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor making it easier for parents to join the channel of the class, many times, public channels are created\u0026hellip; this allows to use a shorter \u0026lsquo;alias\u0026rsquo; but that everyone else can search and find\u0026hellip; and here is the problem\u0026hellip; \u0026rsquo;everyone\u0026rsquo; it\u0026rsquo;s not just parents or other teachers\u0026hellip; if you do the test by searching for \u003ccode\u003eclase de\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003eclasse dels\u003c/code\u003e you\u0026rsquo;ll find lot of groups:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Advice for Telegram usage in education"},{"content":"Red Hat has a program named Co.Lab which provides kits under request that employees can use to guide a STEM session on schools to perform different range of activities.\nWe performed 2 sessions this year, one for the \u0026ldquo;We Are Red Hat Week\u0026rdquo; (WARHW), which happens every year around Halloween, when the first official release was launched back in 31st October 1994 (\u0026lsquo;Halloween Release\u0026rsquo;).\nFor the one at the office in Valencia, the range of ages was a bit wider so we did different kits and the parents were in charge of directing the lab for the kids.\nLater, we performed one at a primary school where 7 years-old kids were constructing a \u0026lsquo;Conversation Machine\u0026rsquo;.\nWe followed this presentation to provide some guidance and introduction based on the work by my colleagues from Barcelona as well as the video that explains the kit.\nThe kit itself contained everything we needed: some instructions about the program, some LEDs, resistors, battery, breadboard, switches and the breadboard to assemble everything.\nOf course\u0026hellip; doing it for almost 50 kids required a bigger box:\nAgain, all of this was provided thanks to Red Hat.\nThe activity was carried with the help of several parents that got an early kit to start practicing at home to be ready to help the students during the experience and finally a simplified version of the circuit was agreed:\nWith this one, we reduced the wiring, so they had more room to place the components so that we also upgraded to use 4 switches and 4 LEDs instead of the original plan which was aiming for just 3.\nTo be honest, the guidance from the parents during the construction made it a very pleasant experience, not a lot of frustration from the kids, as they were able to progress on their own (it was funny to see how they were eager to start opening the boxes for the kits before listening to the explanation) and how they were trying to get it done as soon as possible, but in the end, more or less everyone finished at the same time so we were ready for the last step\u0026hellip;.\nPlaying with it!\nWe decided to take advantage of the 4th led (red, yellow, green and blue) and play a \u0026lsquo;hot-cold\u0026rsquo; game where one teacher or adult left the classroom, the students agreed on someone, and when joining back, the adult should guess who was the selected person to be found\u0026hellip;\nUsing the led lights the kids were indicating how \u0026lsquo;hot, warm, cold, or frozen\u0026rsquo; we were in terms of distance.\nThey really enjoyed a lot the assembling and the game and everyone wanted to be the next one selected for being found by others!\nEnjoy!

You can use ManagedClusterModule resources to configure how to load the module, define ModuleLoader images for kernel versions, and include instructions for building and signing modules for specific kernel versions.\nKMM is designed to accommodate multiple kernel versions at once for any kernel module, allowing for seamless node upgrades and reduced application downtime.\nFor more information about it, refer to the product documentation available at Kernel Module Management Operator | Specialized hardware and driver enablement | OpenShift Container Platform 4.12\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget that also KMM is a community project at kubernetes-sigs/kernel-module-management and that it can be tested on upstream Kubernetes and has a slack community channel at Kubernetes Slack.\nVocabulary In order to make it easier, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use some acronyms and products along this text, find here the most common ones:\nTerm Definition KMM Kernel Module Management ACM Advance Cluster Management OpenShift Red Hat\u0026rsquo;s Kubernetes-based product HUB Central management Cluster that via ACM manages some Spokes Spoke Cluster managed via ACM from a management cluster referred to as Hub SNO Single-Node OpenShift CRD Custom Resource Definition EDGE Relevant to Telco 5G and other use cases, refers to systems that are placed close to the end user making use of the services to get better performance OOT Out-of-tree, referred to Kernel Module The test goal One of the new features coming in KMM 1.1 is the ability to work in Hub-Spoke architectures, by leveraging Advanced Cluster Management capabilities, deploying KMM in this hub-spoke architecture is like a walk in the park.\nThis kind of setup is very common at the EDGE, where data centers have a more resourceful set of servers, while EDGE devices are more resource-constrained, and everything that can be saved, can be used to provide a better experience to the closest users.\nIn this mode, KMM is able to build new kernel drivers for specific releases on the hub cluster, and then, deliver the built images to the spokes clusters, which, using fewer resources can still benefit from hardware enablement which automatically gets updated for each kernel when a newer OpenShift version image gets released.\nThe KMM team wanted to perform these tests and grab metrics on the behavior in a large-scale environment that allowed them to evaluate the action points on the HUB-Spoke scenario.\nThe goal for this test is to reach 1000 nodes deployed with the KMM module and monitor the actual resource utilization for the whole process.\nTest environment We reached out to the ScaleLab team at https://scalelab.redhat.com/ to explain our use case and to request a loan of machines we could use for our testing.\nThe team provided 69 systems in total, all equal, and with the following specifications:\nDell R650 with 512Gb of RAM, 3TB NVME, 21.8Tb SSD + 1 447GB SSD, powered by the Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz processor reported as 112 CPU\u0026rsquo;s (dual processor, 56 cores, 112 threads). In order to set up the environment, we used 4 hosts for base infrastructure, designed to become:\n1 Bastion for deploying other hosts and interacting with the environment (Ansible playbook execution, mirror registry, etc.). 3 nodes for creating an OpenShift Baremetal Compact cluster that will hold the hub cluster. The remaining 65 hosts were configured as hypervisors for running virtual machines with KVM to be used as Single Node OpenShift (SNO) clusters.\nNode Hardware CPU RAM(GiB) Disk(GiB) Count Bastion Dell R650 112 512 446 SSD / 2x1.8TB SSD / 2.9TB NVMe 1 Hub BM Cluster Dell R650 112 512 446 SSD / 2x1.8TB SSD / 2.9TB NVMe 3 SNO HV Dell R650 112 512 446 SSD / 2x1.8TB SSD / 2.9TB NVMe 65 SNO VM Libvirt KVM 8 18 120 1755 (max) It might sound easy to achieve, but in reality, there are several things to take into account in order to set up the whole environment:\nConfigure all the relevant hosts and get access to them using Ansible. Enable the required packages and services for virtualization. Define the network cards for the VM\u0026rsquo;s to be interconnected and able to reach the hub. Have proper sizing and placing of the VM\u0026rsquo;s so that the faster hard drives are used for holding the VM disks and avoid extra workload because of VM density causing disk pressure on the same drive. Most of this logic is already present in the scripts at https://github.com/redhat-performance/jetlag/ repository, which is pretty tied to the SCALELAB environment that we were going to use for this setup to prepare and configure the relevant resources for this task.\nIn total we got 27 VMs per host, getting to a total of 1755 potential SNOs. Note the word potential here… we\u0026rsquo;re setting up the infrastructure to mimic real hardware:\nRemotely power on and off the VMs (using sushy-tools to interact with libvirt). KVM for running the VMs. Etc. Each SNO is configured with 8 VCPU and 18Gb of RAM, which is in line with the bare minimum requirements to get OpenShift deployed.\nFor example, we had to alter the limits for the KMM deployment in order to allow it to use more memory during the module build, which was initially limited to 128Mb of RAM and was not enough for the compilation of the module.\nWe were pretty lucky and after the whole process of deployment in this restricted scenario, configuration, ACM deployment, and provisioning of the clusters, only one cluster failed ‘sno01412’, out of 1755 SNOs in total.\nNote that some other spokes will be discarded in the next paragraphs.\nFor this setup, and to avoid external issues, we decided to do the installation following the disconnected IPv6 approach, that is, the bastion is running an internal registry which is later configured in all clusters via a CatalogSource:\napiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1 kind: CatalogSource metadata: name: rh-du-operators namespace: openshift-marketplace spec: displayName: disconnected-redhat-operators image: d20-h01-000-r650:5000/olm-mirror/redhat-operator-index:v4.12 publisher: Red Hat sourceType: grpc updateStrategy: registryPoll: interval: 1h This process is performed automatically as part of the scripts used to deploy the environment, but we wanted to validate and fix some hosts that failed to apply the policy that automatically was configuring it.\nIn order to prepare the setup, we also had to mirror into our registry the KMM Operator, and for the reporting, we also added the Grafana operator.\nAs a side issue, we ran out of disk space in the bastion, as we were only using the 500 GB SSD, so we\u0026rsquo;ve noted this to automatically set additional space on /var/lib/containers on the bastion using extra disks.\nAlso, as we switched from IPv4 to IPv6, we were required to perform some manual cleanup of leftovers that could have caused some of the instabilities we saw in previous attempts.\nThe Grafana instance OpenShift already includes a Grafana dashboard, together with ACM, that can show some information about the bare-metal cluster we will use for management.\nHowever, in order to be able to customize the dashboard, we are required to install a custom instance. This custom instance is what we\u0026rsquo;ll show in the next screenshots to highlight the behavior of the cluster and the numbers obtained.\nOur results As a briefing, we\u0026rsquo;ve 1754 valid possible SNOs (deployed and in operation).\nOut of those, 6 spokes were removed, as they failed in different steps (test upgrade of OpenShift, operators in a non-working state, etc).\nSo 1748, is the real number of spokes available for deploying KMM\nKMM installation For deploying KMM we used the operator, to get it added on the Hub.\nUsing ACM, we defined a policy to also add it to the managed clusters, so that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;ll be seeing in the next graphs.\nFirst, the KMM Hub installation started at 11:42, and we can see some data on the following graph:\nAs we started the spokes installation in the period between 12:17 and 12:23 we can also see that after the initial setup of the hub and some activity during the spokes installation, the usage of resources is more or less steady, we can see a bump to a new level around 13:30, but this was once all the activity for deployment has finished.\nWe can compare this pattern as well with the SNO\u0026rsquo;s resources usage:\nThe SNOs were already active but without too much load in RAM or CPU, as a big part of the installation is just deploying the required components in the clusters.\nIf we focus on the average graphs to avoid the spikes of regular activity we can see some patterns:\nAnd for the spokes:\nIn general, Hub has been unaffected, and in the SNOs, we have a bit more activity in average and RAM usage, but if we check the numbers it\u0026rsquo;s around 200Mb of RAM usage in difference, so not a big deal in terms of resource consumption.\nIn terms of KMM controllers, we can see it really clearly here:\nThe number of KMM controllers increased in a really short period of time and got to the total number of operative SNOs\nModule installation Now that KMM has been installed, we need to actually deploy a module, this will cause KMM to compile it, and prepare the relevant images that the Spokes will consume.\nThe module used for this test is a really simple module called kmm-kmod which is part of the KMM project. It just prints a “Hello World” and a “Goodbye World” message to the kernel log but it is suitable for testing building and loading kernel modules with KMM like any other ‘production’ module would be.\nIn our case, we first got the module compiled and installed prior to our testing so that we can compare the workload increase when the module is already prepared in the hub and ready for distribution.\nIn this case, the container that was already working in the HUB started to be deployed and we can check the count change here:\nAround 13:30, all SNOs got the module container up and running and repeated the graphs provided earlier for the whole period, we can see that hub increased memory usage\nAnd for the spokes:\nAs we can see that once KMM was installed, a bump in the memory (under 200Mb) happened, but no appreciable change once the module was loaded.\nNote that in this situation, the hub creates the module (compilation, etc), builds the image, and then ACM does the deployment to the spokes.\nFrom the numbers, we see that 100% of the operative SNOs deployed the KMM controller and loaded the module within a really short timeframe with no noticeable impact.\nModule upgrade One of the tests we wanted to perform was to get SNOs to do a kernel upgrade, in this way, we can test KMM by doing the new module compilation itself and then, delivering the updated kernel module to the spoke clusters.\nThis, of course, has an implication… a way to get a newer kernel on the SNO nodes… is by actually upgrading OpenShift itself.\nThis, which might sound easy, means having to mirror the required images for the newer OpenShift release, apply an ICSP to all the SNOs, as well as adding the signatures for validating the new image, and of course, launch the upgrade itself.\nThe Hub started the upgrade at 16:20, moving from a starting OpenShift version 4.12.3 to the final version 4.12.6 which was previously mirrored, with the relevant signatures added, etc.\nThe upgrade took around 90 minutes in total for the Hub, and once the Hub moved to 4.12.6, it recompiled the Kernel module.\nIn our tests, we tested manually on the first SNO (sno0001), and once validated, this was launched for all the remaining and active nodes.\nThe timing was the following:\n18:22 First SNO (sno0001) and others start applying YAML for version signatures and for ICSP (just missing the upgrade itself). 18:24 script to launch all the upgrades in parallel started. 19:38: 1500 updated, 249 in progress. 19:49: 4 nodes failed the OpenShift Upgrade. 22:51: all SNOs, including the failing ones, are upgraded to 4.12.6. Out of the total count, 4 nodes didn\u0026rsquo;t come back (API not responding), a manual reboot of the SNO\u0026rsquo;s got them into API responding, and apparently good progress towards finishing the upgrade to the 4.12.6 release.\nThe upgrade itself, as it took time, caused no appreciable load on the Hub itself, but as highlighted, several SNO hosts did not perform the upgrade properly.\nFinally as just a confirmation about what we were expecting:\nThe Hub did perform a build once the first SNO required the new kernel, but the spokes did no builds at all (which is the exact use case of HUB-Spoke architecture)\nSummary Milestones Check the graphs and milestones for the whole process\n11:42 KMM installation at HUB. 12:17-12:23 KMM installation at SNOs (controller). 13:30 KMM KMOD added and deployed to all SNOs. 16:20 HUB OpenShift upgrade from 4.12.3 to 4.12.6. 17:50 Hub upgrade finished. 18:22 First SNO (sno0001) and others start applying YAML for version signatures and for ICSP (just missing the upgrade itself). 18:24 script to launch all the upgrades in parallel started. 19:38: 1500 updated, 249 in progress. 19:49: 4 nodes failed the OpenShift Upgrade. 22:51: all SNOs, including the failing ones, are upgraded to 4.12.6.

N/A N/A N/A N/A Spoke (total) N/A N/A N/A N/A Lessons learned As highlighted in the previous paragraphs this test has been affected by several infrastructure issues:\nOpenShift deployment (SNO installation) by ACM. OpenShift Upgrades (SNOs failing in the upgrade and requiring manual intervention). Also, some other difficulties played in this:\nThe infrastructure uses a dense number of VMs to simulate the clusters and this can cause: Bottlenecks on the network during the installation of SNOs. Netmask requiring adjustment when using IPv4, or using IPv6. Using IPv6 requires using a disconnected environment, which requires extra work for ‘simple\u0026rsquo; things like: Mirroring the images. Deploying new operators (like the custom Grafana for customizing the dashboard). We\u0026rsquo;ve contributed back some of the found issues to the jetlag repository to reduce some of the problems found, but still, there were a lot of manual tasks required for setting up the environment itself.\nIn the end, the KMM test was very smooth and the results were along the expected lines: little to no impact at all on the clusters, but all the preparation work involved in the setup, and troubleshooting everything else involved, took most of the time.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth considering investing extra time in shaping those scripts and setups to make them more straightforward when a team is going to scale test a product and avoid the hassle of dealing with all the nits and picks from the environment itself which could be considered as infrastructure and not really a part of the test itself.\nThanks We want to give special thanks to the following who helped contribute to the success of this endeavor:\nScale Lab team Alex Krzos Edge Pillar, Partner Accelerator team ","permalink":"https://iranzo.io/blog/2023/06/21/kmm-1.1-scale-testing/","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"admonition attention\"\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"admonition-title\"\u003eAttention\u003c/p\u003e\n    \u003cp class=\"admonition\"\u003eFirst published at \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/scale-testing-kernel-module-management\"\u003ehttps://cloud.redhat.com/blog/scale-testing-kernel-module-management\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKernel Module Management (KMM) Operator manages, builds, signs and deploys out-of-tree kernel modules and device plugins on OpenShift Container Platform clusters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKMM adds, for the HUB/Spoke scenario, a new ManagedClusterModule which describes an out-of-tree kernel module and its associated device plugin.

package, but as a code in a repository (which unfortunately, it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty common situation).\nAs a part of the ansible playbooks used for the hosts, I can add a snippet like this:\ngitrepos: - { url: \u0026#34;https://github.com/myrepo/repo.git\u0026#34;, tag: \u0026#34;tagtocheckout\u0026#34;, folder: \u0026#34;/root/path-for-check-out\u0026#34;, chdir: \u0026#34;subdir to enter\u0026#34;, build: \u0026#34;make build\u0026#34;, exec: \u0026#34;build/mybuiltbinary\u0026#34;, } With this definition in the host inventory, we can then in our playbook to perform several steps:\nFirst Checkout the repository, note that we loop over gitrepos variable and use the items defined.

In the case of the included wrapper, it still could cause issues as some parallelization was included, but when used together with risu.py the problem became more apparent.\nFinally the workaround used is a small function added that checks if there\u0026rsquo;s a running oc debug check, and if so, waiting a random delay of seconds, which effectively doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the execution, but allows to use the plugins normally:\nocdebugorwait() { instances=$(pgrep -f \u0026#39;oc debug\u0026#39; | wc -l) while [ \u0026#34;${instances}\u0026#34; != \u0026#34;0\u0026#34; ]; do # Waiting for oc debug to not be anymore sleep $(($RANDOM % 10)) instances=$(pgrep -f \u0026#39;oc debug\u0026#39; | wc -l) done When invoked in the scripts with ocdebugorwait the code enters this loop before attempting the oc debug command.\nWith this patch, the reported output is obtained, and of course, properly shown in the HTML interface while doing troubleshooting with Risu.

The new version, that was released at around 18 months later contained so many changes that it was hard to test the upgrades themselves until leapp was introduced.\nCheck the lifecycle here: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata\nHowever, the biggest problem could be the incompatibility of packages or package formats\u0026hellip; but as usually there were some middle layers it was possible to upgrade without reinstallation by performing some manual steps.\nWarning\nThis procedure is completely unsupported, it should not be used on production systems and doesn\u0026rsquo;t ensure service availability during the upgrade. Or even system availability once finished\u0026hellip;\nIn the past, the method that could be used, was to provide the upgradeany parameter to anaconda installer via the command line options, but this still required to boot from an ISO (or physical media) to perform the upgrade, and have little chance of recovery in case of any failure during the installation as anaconda environment was very limited in recovery options.\nIn brief:\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll move in unsupported ways from one release to another Package dependencies will require removing some packages or forcing installations ignoring dependencies that might cause issues At some point, if a power cut happens, the system might not be recoverable as it will be missing important parts. There could be leftovers in the system This will be a lengthy, process and prone to failure Upgrade the systems always before you reach to this situation, this is not something you want to do on regular basis because product has reached End-Of-Life (EOL) It should be easier to work on automating deployments and configurations so in the future you can redeploy on newer releases or newer hardware and get a track of all the performed configurations, etc, ideally on a control version system for traceability. Downloading files from older servers might be difficult, or even connecting to them, because of now obsoleted SSL or other crypto libraries. Don\u0026rsquo;t do this unless you want to fully risk the system you had For each release, try to download .0 and .latest versions, we will use .0 when upgrading from prior major, and before moving to next major version, we\u0026rsquo;ll update to the latest minor\u0026hellip; in this way we might catch some errors of packages not upgraded or procedures\u0026hellip; like kernel scripts that might install on the .0 but end up in an unbootable system, moving from .0 to .latest will allows us to reduce the chances of hitting this kind of issues. Preparation steps In order to start, it is safe to perform some steps:\nPerform a backup and prepare for reinstallation Ensure there\u0026rsquo;s enough free disk Get a copy of the install media on the system we\u0026rsquo;re going to update and have it at hand in case we need to recover Use tmux1 or screen as screen multiplexers so that we can recover in case of network connectivity issues Ensure that tools like wget are installed Have access to remote console, either via BMC or the virtualization platform if that\u0026rsquo;s the case. Check the documentation for the next release to see what are the breaking changes included in the release notes for each version, this will give us some hints about packages that we were using and are no longer available in our system. Upgrade the system To have a smoother experience, first step is to fully update the system to the latest version of the packages\n# EL5 onwards yum update --skip-broken Once we made sure that no further updates are available we\u0026rsquo;re ready for the next steps.\nDownload the install media to the system As indicated in the previous section, we need to download the install media to the system, this will make sure that we\u0026rsquo;ll have available a copy we can use without requiring network access to install whatever is needed in our host.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll mount it to /mnt and create a repository file for using it in each release step. For mounting, we\u0026rsquo;ll execute:\nmount -o loop /root/rhel${VERSION}.iso /mnt Attempting the update The package managers yum and dnf include a flag that might be really useful as long as we\u0026rsquo;ve compatible repositories or we\u0026rsquo;ve made available our ISO install media on our system and created a custom repo definition for it.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll follow this procedure on a RHEL base system, starting with RHEL 4.8 until RHEL 9 Beta.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get ready on the environment\u0026hellip;\nRHEL 4.8 installation Proceed to install RHEL 4.8 via the ISO on the system so that we\u0026rsquo;ve the test-bed ready for our procedure. Note\nAs you might have experienced\u0026hellip; using a recent system to connect to a legacy one could be complicated as some insecure protocols have been disabled.\nCreate an entry like this in your .ssh/config file, so that insecure methods can be used to connect:\nHost 192.168.2.82 HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa KexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa User root or alternatively on the command line:\nssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa root@192.168.2.8 RHEL 4.8 used up2date as method for connecting to RHN, however, as it is out of the support cycle I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect to get RHN working for it.\nAt that time, CentOS had the chance to create repositories and copy over the yum command so that it could be used on it, but let\u0026rsquo;s try to use what we\u0026rsquo;ve in the system\u0026hellip; first of all, we need to load the RHEL ISO image into our system.\nAs we don\u0026rsquo;t have access to RHN, let\u0026rsquo;s loopback mount the ISO image and let\u0026rsquo;s install screen:\n[root@rhel-instance mnt]# mount /root/rhel4.8.iso /mnt [root@rhel-instance mnt]# cd /mnt [root@rhel-instance mnt]# rpm -Uvh RedHat/RPMS/screen-4.0.2-5.x86_64.rpm Preparing... ########################################### [100%] 1:screen ########################################### [100%] [root@rhel-instance mnt]# From this point, we should execute screen and continue working from within that shell\nWe can now cd into our user home folder and umount /mnt to start the process.\nRHEL 4.8 to RHEL 5.x upgrade First, let\u0026rsquo;s mount RHEL 5.x CD-ROM on /mnt and let\u0026rsquo;s start over\u0026hellip;\nIn RHEL5, we used to have the main OS packages in the Server/ folder so let\u0026rsquo;s cd into it via cd /mnt/Server.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with rpm the first attempt would be to use rpm -Fvh *.rpm to freshen all the packages, that is, install the updated versions and carry on\u0026hellip; but we\u0026rsquo;ll get into a dependency hell, and if you attempt it, lot of the installed packages might have been already removed, and not be possible to upgrade\u0026hellip;\nTo make our life easier, we need to do whatever we can to get yum and rpm packages updated to RHEL 5 versions, so that we can later use yum for the dependency resolution.\nNow, we begin a loop of package additions and removals to get to some state we can move forward\u0026hellip;\nWhen we first attempt to update rpm, yum, etc. we begging requiring python and upgrading it will complain about some of the system-config-lvm or system-config-network\u0026hellip; so the procedure is a try-and-error approach:\nrpm -e system-config-lvm rpm -e system-config-network rpm -e system-config-packages rpm -e gnome-python2-bonobo gnome-python2 gnome-python2-canvas And then start attempting to upgrade yum and rpm while you get into dependency hell like this:\nSo\u0026hellip; we realized it is a pain, so let\u0026rsquo;s grab some \u0026lsquo;CentOS\u0026rsquo; packages from the CentOS 4.9 VAULT that we can use to get yum working:\npython-elementtree-1.2.6-5.el4.centos.x86_64.rpm python-sqlite-1.1.7-1.2.1.x86_64.rpm python-urlgrabber-2.9.8-2.noarch.rpm sqlite-3.3.6-2.x86_64.rpm yum-2.4.3-4.el4.centos.noarch.rpm yum-metadata-parser-1.0-8.el4.centos.x86_64.rpm Let\u0026rsquo;s copy them to our system (in case we haven\u0026rsquo;t downloaded them there) and let\u0026rsquo;s install them\u0026hellip; using --nodeps as the packages require yumconf that we will not find as a built package:\n# Disable SELinux Enforcing setenforce 0 # Preferably, configure SElinux to be in permissive mode via editing the /etc/selinux/config file and setting it to \u0026#39;SELINUX=permissive\u0026#39; # Install the packages for yum rpm -Uvh --nodeps python-elementtree-1.2.6-5.el4.centos.x86_64.rpm python-sqlite-1.1.7-1.2.1.x86_64.rpm python-urlgrabber-2.9.8-2.noarch.rpm sqlite-3.3.6-2.x86_64.rpm yum-2.4.3-4.el4.centos.noarch.rpm yum-metadata-parser-1.0-8.el4.centos.x86_64.rpm Now, let\u0026rsquo;s create a repo file at /etc/yum.repos.d/cdrom.repo with the following contents:\n[cdrom] name=CDROM baseurl=file:///mnt/Server/ enabled=1 gpgcheck=0 From this point, we could use yum to install packages\u0026hellip;\nFirst packages to upgrade should be\u0026hellip; again\u0026hellip; yum and rpm and it will start several dependency loop checks that we\u0026rsquo;ll need to resolve\u0026hellip; but in a lot easier way than having to manually specify the packages to upgrade.\nAs we\u0026rsquo;re on a server, let\u0026rsquo;s remove some more packages to get this progressing:\nrpm -e pcmcia-cs pm-utils bluez-utils rpm -e xorg-x11-xfs chkfontpath urw-fonts rpm -e kudzu system-config-mouse system-config-network-tui system-config-soundcard --nodeps rpm -e autofs libgnomeui up2date Now, let\u0026rsquo;s update some packages:\nyum update hwdata --\u0026gt;

we can\u0026rsquo;t install the packages because our installed version is old, and until we update them, we can\u0026rsquo;t install the other updates\u0026hellip; and even cpio is older than the version used, so we might need to use an intermediate machine to uncompress the rpm related packages copy them over, and use them to install the updates on the system itself.\nWe need to prepare and uncompress the following files from the install media on a newer machine\nPACKAGES=\u0026#34;db4-4.7.25-16.el6.x86_64.rpm glibc-2.12-1.7.el6.x86_64.rpm glibc-common-2.12-1.7.el6.x86_64.rpm glibc-utils-2.12-1.7.el6.x86_64.rpm libcap-2.16-5.2.el6.x86_64.rpm lua-5.1.4-4.1.el6.x86_64.rpm popt-1.13-7.el6.x86_64.rpm rpm-4.8.0-12.el6.x86_64.rpm rpm-build-4.8.0-12.el6.x86_64.rpm rpm-libs-4.8.0-12.el6.x86_64.rpm rpm-python-4.8.0-12.el6.x86_64.rpm xz-libs-4.999.9-0.3.beta.20091007git.el6.x86_64.rpm\u0026#34;

note, this will overwrite libraries, binaries and can render your system unusable.\nOnce that step is done\u0026hellip; your system should have RPM version 4.8.0 and you can use it to install and force install several set of packages\u0026hellip; until you can get yum working again\u0026hellip;\nIn this case, yum provided in EL6, features the distro-sync command, which is a simple way to update the system to the latest available packages in our local repository.\nYum might complain of some missing packages.. ensure to get yum packages installed, as well as expat, SSL and some other dependencies that will complain.\nOnce YUM is working and distro-sync has finished, we need to edit the cdrom.repo to act against the folder with the packages (so that it has the group information), perform a yum clean and then yum groupinstall base so that all the missing packages from a base system are installed.. resolving conflicts like the redhat-release-notes etc by manually removing and then adding the new versions of the files.\nEnsure also to remove all packages named .el5. from our system\u0026hellip; we should be on el6 now\u0026hellip;\nAnd our system is ready for next step!\nRHEL6 to RHEL7 upgrade Well, we got until this point, so we\u0026rsquo;re back into the versions that are \u0026lsquo;supported\u0026rsquo; under the ELS.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s follow the standard approach to register our system and attach to a pool:\nyum -y install subscription-manager subscription-manager register subscription-manager attach pool=XXXXXXX Then, let\u0026rsquo;s add extra repositories we might require:\nsubscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-extras-rpms subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms # And then, let\u0026#39;s install preupgrade tools yum install preupgrade-assistant preupgrade-assistant-el6toel7 redhat-upgrade-tool Check for the next steps in the official documentation:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/upgrading_from_rhel_6_to_rhel_7/index\nEnjoy!

It has one of those rubber coatings that make it comfortable at hand when it\u0026rsquo;s new, but it\u0026rsquo;s sticky once it gets older (had similar experience with other stuff, even umbrellas\u0026hellip;)\nSome alcohol and a soft cloth helped removing that stickiness, so next step was to test it\u0026hellip; plugged the receiver in the USB port, and put two batteries in\u0026hellip; and it powered up, bot left and right buttons were working, and the laser pointer. Thing is that the remote has two additional buttons for starting presentation and going to blank screen that didn\u0026rsquo;t worked.\nIn a rush, I thought about opening it, thinking that the reason of having it discarded was that one, but nothing strange in the inside, everything was clean, no battery spill, etc, so I reassembled and started looking for information about it.\nUsing xev I was able to see that the key buttons were received on the computer, the one on the left, provided two different key codes and the one on the right just one, but was not mapped to anything.\nAfter some search, I found this blog post, but a copy-paste didn\u0026rsquo;t worked\u0026hellip; seems that the USB receiver had changed the identifier in the meantime so I had to update to match mines.\nFirst of all, I did checked with lsusb the device ID and Vendor ID, which was 046D and C52D, so I used those values when filling the next two files.\nFirst, I created /etc/udev/hwdb.d/99-logitech-r400.hwdb:\n# The lower left button actually emits two # different scancodes depending on the state of # the \u0026#34;presentation\u0026#34;. # E.g. one code to start and one to stop. keyboard:usb:v046DpC52D KEYBOARD_KEY_70029=up KEYBOARD_KEY_7003E=up KEYBOARD_KEY_70037=down KEYBOARD_KEY_7004B=left KEYBOARD_KEY_7004E=right This file is mapping the two events in the left button to be \u0026lsquo;up\u0026rsquo; and the one on the right to be \u0026lsquo;down\u0026rsquo;\u0026hellip; I did this because in the past I used to do some presentations using reveal.js and it was interesting to have those kind of several-level presentations, so that you could go in deep on a topic or move to next one depending on the time available\nand /etc/udev/rules.d/99-logitech-r400.rules:\nSUBSYSTEMS==\u0026#34;usb\u0026#34;, ATTRS{idVendor}==\u0026#34;046d\u0026#34;, ATTRS{idProduct}==\u0026#34;c52d\u0026#34;, IMPORT{builtin}=\u0026#34;hwdb \u0026#39;keyboard:usb:v046DpC52D\u0026#39;\u0026#34;, RUN{builtin}+=\u0026#34;keyboard\u0026#34; The first file, defines the key mappings, so that the actual 4 buttons, work as I wanted, and the second one, ensures that when the device is plugged, the mappings will be loaded\u0026hellip; after this, just unplug and replug, and voilà, the presenter was working perfectly\u0026hellip; so nice finding, nice recycling via \u0026lsquo;reuse\u0026rsquo; and new toy!.\nEnjoy!

or \u0026#39;something else\u0026#39; wgport: port number to use The first step was to create the private and public key once the wireguard package is installed.\nThis was more or less easy, just run and store the output in the folder for WireGuard.\n# Create private key wg genkey | tee privatekey # Create public key wg pubkey \u0026lt; privatekey | tee publickey Later, I could set via Ansible\u0026rsquo;s set_fact:\n- name: Set WireGuard keys set_fact: wgprivatekey: \u0026#34;{{ lookup(\u0026#39;file\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;privatekey\u0026#39;) }}\u0026#34;

: \\\u0026#34;$(cat /etc/wireguard/privatekey)\\\u0026#34;}\u0026#34; Fact for public key:\n#!/bin/bash echo \u0026#34;{\\\u0026#34;wgpubkey\\\u0026#34; : \\\u0026#34;$(cat /etc/wireguard/publickey)\\\u0026#34;}\u0026#34; Note that both, provide output in a JSON compatible format.\nWe now need to copy the facts to the hosts and refresh the data if needed:\n- name: Create directory for ansible custom facts file: state: directory recurse: yes path: /etc/ansible/facts.d register: facts_dir_created - name: Copy custom facts copy: src: \u0026#34;{{ item }}\u0026#34; dest: /etc/ansible/facts.d/ owner: root group: root mode: 0755 with_fileglob: - \u0026#34;facts/*.fact\u0026#34; register: facts_copied - name: \u0026#34;Re-run setup to use custom facts\u0026#34; setup: ~ when: facts_copied.changed Now\u0026hellip; all hosts have the facts for private and public key so that can be used\u0026hellip; but we need to actually create WireGuard configuration file for it\u0026hellip; but wait\u0026hellip; we need to know which host is the master that will receive all connections from the clients.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s detect the master by the wgrole value:\n- name: Set wireguard master server host set_fact: wgmaster: \u0026#34;{{ item }}\u0026#34; with_items: \u0026#34;{{ groups.all }}\u0026#34; when: hostvars[item].wgrole is defined and hostvars[item].wgrole == \u0026#39;master\u0026#39; and wireguard == True Above task will loop across all hosts, check for the wgrole defined and equal to master (with wireguard enabled), and set the wgmaster fact to the hostname.\nWe will also need to calculate the IP to use for the master and the client in a private range\u0026hellip; so let\u0026rsquo;s just get the number of item in the list for this:\n- name: Calculate IP for host set_fact: wgip: \u0026#34;10.0.0.{{ lookup(\u0026#39;ansible.utils.index_of\u0026#39;, groups.all, \u0026#39;eq\u0026#39;, inventory_hostname) }}\u0026#34; Now, each host will get a \u0026lsquo;fact\u0026rsquo; wgip with the content similar to 10.0.0.1 that we can use to connect them.\nSo\u0026hellip; we should have all the information to create the configuration file for each client host:\n- name: Create configuration file for client copy: dest: \u0026#34;/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf\u0026#34; mode: 0644 content: | [Interface] ListenPort = {{ wgport }} PrivateKey = {{ ansible_local.wgprivkey.wgprivkey }} [Peer] PublicKey = {{ hostvars[wgmaster].ansible_local.wgpubkey.wgpubkey }} AllowedIPs = {{ hostvars[wgmaster].wgip }}/32 Endpoint = {{ hostvars[wgmaster].inventory_hostname }}:{{ hostvars[wgmaster].wgport }} when: wireguard == True and wgrole is defined and wgrole != \u0026#39;master\u0026#39; In above example, check that we use hostvars with the wgmaster value we obtained, in order to fill-in the values for the master, and make use of ansible_local to grab the values that our custom facts generated.\nSo far, it has been more or less easy\u0026hellip; the problem is that in the master, we need to build a base section ([Interface]) and then, ad the client section ([Peer]) with the client\u0026rsquo;s public key and the IP of the client.\nNext, let\u0026rsquo;s check the one for the master:\n- name: Create configuration file for master copy: dest: \u0026#34;/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf\u0026#34; mode: 0644 content: | [Interface] ListenPort = {{ wgport }} PrivateKey = {{ hostvars[wgmaster].ansible_local.wgprivkey.wgprivkey }} {%- for item in hostvars -%} {% if hostvars[item].wgrole is defined and hostvars[item].wgrole != \u0026#39;master\u0026#39;

So, since January, I was enrolled in this effort :-)\nAs Miguel had an outline of the topics to cover for each chapter, it was easy to use the freedom we had to cover them, the examples, but of course, always having in sight the focus on the tasks that a system administrator would perform at RHCSA level. One of the metrics we had, was the expected page count, but also, it was flexible and some chapters were bigger than expected and some others, smaller, of course, depending on the topic and well\u0026hellip;. we finally exceeded in about 100 pages the expected page count.\nOn the tech side, I\u0026rsquo;m used to Markdown and I\u0026rsquo;ve used it at several roles in my career, and lately, I was doing Asciidoctor. I\u0026rsquo;m not a big expert in Asciidoctor but it had many features that I felt being useful for the book, however, to my surprise, the tool of choice was a word processor with some custom styling. I understand, that using a regular word processor makes it easier for other writers, and having version control was also useful, but still was a bit strange for me, as I was used to code reviews, easy to perform on text files, and also, doing cross-references between different documents. Even when working with SuSE on the manuals, the choice was LaTeX, which was even harder but allowed rich features on the final rendering.\nOn the other side, the Packt team provided good guidance for starting:\nStyling guide with some example documents demonstrating each style usage Shared drive for uploading the files and work on reviews And lot of support for the questions that arise And what was more invaluable: guidance by several members of the team about the styles to use, tense, writing style, etc\nThe process was quite fast, once each chapter was submitted, in few days or a week, there were some reviews and later, a technical reviewer did the same, providing a feedback form on the chapter and some other things to fix or improve.\nIn the end, going chapter after chapter, it went quickly through\u0026hellip; my biggest pain points were the chapters where I felt that there was nothing else to add, and writing just for increasing the page count was not something we had in mind, and of course, the Packt team supported us in the decision.\nI think that the hardest chapter was the two on exercises\u0026hellip; the book has two knowledge-check-in chapters and once the first was done, thinking about a second without repeating many of the stuff in the first one was not easy.\nJune arrived, all the chapters were delivered and some other reviews were still ongoing on the last chapters, so the book was almost finished and ready for the last steps.\nThe last stone in the road meant little effective work for us as it was mostly adjusting some of the wording and paperwork, but once we got clearance in September (close to three months to complete), we were able to move into the final stage.\nLooking back, it has been a good experience, which somehow was shaking the way I was writing before (as writing Knowledge Base Articles, requires using another styling for the phrasing, etc.), going more direct and engaging more with the reader, but very positive.\nFinally, when everything was done, another member of the Packt team did start over with the book, doing quality assurance, checking the content, clarity, etc, like a second Technical reviewer, before handing it over to the marketing team to work on the promotion of the book on social media.\nWill I do this once again? of course!\n","permalink":"https://iranzo.io/blog/2021/09/15/the-experience-of-writing-a-book/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI wanted to write about my experience (before I forget about it), and as some colleagues asked about it\u0026hellip; here we go\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs published in the blog entry \u003ca href=\"/blog/2021/09/11/book-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-administration/\"\u003eRHEL8 Administration book\u003c/a\u003e, some colleagues and I wrote a book on RHEL8 administration, which can be bought \u003ca href=\"https://s.iranzo.io/rhel8\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany years ago I started one about Linux, but every time a new paragraph was added, a lot of new \u0026lsquo;TO-DO\u0026rsquo; items were appended as the information growth\u0026hellip; and as it was a \u0026lsquo;solo\u0026rsquo; project, I had other stuff to work on and was parked.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"The experience of writing a book"},{"content":"After some time working on it (about 6 months for the main work and some more time for the reviews) with my colleagues Miguel and Scott, we\u0026rsquo;ve finally made it thanks to the support from our families and Packt, as well as several members of RH teams that gave the clearance to get it out!\nThe book targets users willing to learn skills to administer Red Hat Enterprise Linux or compatible systems.

spam messages of any topic.\nThere are many bots for controlling when a user joins, by showing a CAPTCHA that user must resolve (either clicking a button, answering a mathematical operation, inputting a CAPTCHA image text, etc).\nSome time ago, a colleague was using Machine Learning and I wanted to have a look at it and it would make a good feature to implement.\nFirst thing I wanted, was to get rid of the spammers, so the first approach was to include a new command on redken_bot to mark with /spam when replying to a message to take some actions.\nThe /spam command also required some protection from abuse, so it should only work for admins.\nThe admin detection In the beginning some of the commands added to redken_bot had admin access that required the user to define the list of administrators via the admin configuration variable\u0026hellip; but no one did.\nWith some changes in the telegram BOT API, the bot can get (when added as one of the admins in your group) the membership permission updates, so when a membership update arrives (new user added as admin or admin user becoming regular user), the bot will call the function to refresh the list of administrators and use it to update the admin variable automatically.\nThis required changing the way calls were made to get new telegram updates, but I enabled all the possible types of messages, as well as rewriting the function processing the data out of each message, but was a good improvement (even if invisible for outside users.)\nSpam actions Once the admin detection was solved and running (bot currently is member of 549 groups and has 28252 unique users, and only 20 groups have the admin variable set), the next step was to work on the spam actions.\nMany times I was manually doing the stuff:\nDeleting message Kicking user and reporting as spam Sometimes even noting user UID to add to a blocklist So I decided to create a new command /spam which automates part of the job:\nDeletes message Stores UID in the database as spammer Kicks user out of the chat Buttons for easier usage It would be great to have automatic detection, and easier reporting, so next step was playing a bit with buttons.\nTo be honest, never used them except for some attempts, but as I was playing with updated messages for the admin stuff, so was worth to use the feature that was there to add extra parameters to the call.\nyes = \u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34; no = \u0026#34;No\u0026#34; ignore = \u0026#34;Ignore\u0026#34; isthisspammsg = \u0026#34;Is this spam?\u0026#34; extra = ( \u0026#39;reply_markup={\u0026#34;inline_keyboard\u0026#34;:[[{\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;%s\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;callback_data\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;SPAM\u0026#34;},{\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;%s\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;callback_data\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;HAM\u0026#34;},{\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;%s\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;callback_data\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;IGNORE\u0026#34;}]]}\u0026#39; % (yes, no, ignore) ) With above approach, the bot could reply to messages and attach an inline-keyboard with configurable buttons, returning as part of the callback data the message I wanted (HAM,SPAM or IGNORE).\nThis, also required to process the callback_data that we were now collecting since the changes added for the admin status change.\nThe good thing is that the answer provided when pressing the button, contains reference to the original message, so it was easier to later catch the text we were replying with the buttons.\nMachine learning Machine learning more or less, is showing data to an algorithm with results tagged in one or either way, divide the set of data between a training group and a test group and feed it to the algorithm to find how good it has been.\nFor doing so, it converts the input data into numbers and tries to find relationships between them. This also opens the pandora box as it has lot of different approaches, depending on the function being used for doing the conversion, for example, some of them use frequency of elements, removing the less frequent, etc\nFinally, using the model the program can classify new data, based on the model that was elaborated, and in order to improve it, the data should be refreshed with new patterns for both cases: ham and spam so that it can continue evolving.\nThere are lot of documents about this, the shortest example I can think of is:\nfrom langdetect import detect from nltk.corpus import stopwords from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline import logging import nltk import os import pandas as pd import pickle import dill import string import sys logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) logger.debug(\u0026#34;Downloading updated stopwords\u0026#34;) nltk.download(\u0026#34;stopwords\u0026#34;) logger.debug(\u0026#34;Starting training with on-disk databases\u0026#34;) message = pd.read_csv( \u0026#34;spam/spam.%s.csv\u0026#34; % language, sep=\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;, names=[\u0026#34;Category\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Message\u0026#34;] ) # Drop duplicate messages message.drop_duplicates(inplace=True) # Split the messages between train and test msg_train, msg_test, label_train, label_test = train_test_split( message[\u0026#34;Message\u0026#34;], message[\u0026#34;Category\u0026#34;], test_size=0.2 ) # Define the function for our language pipeline = Pipeline( [ ( \u0026#34;bow\u0026#34;, CountVectorizer( analyzer=lambda text: process_text(text, language=languages[language]) ), ), (\u0026#34;tfidf\u0026#34;, TfidfTransformer()), (\u0026#34;classifier\u0026#34;, MultinomialNB()), ] ) logger.debug(\u0026#34;Training the algorithm for language: %s\u0026#34; % language) pipeline.fit(msg_train, label_train) # Evaluate the model on the training data set print(\u0026#34;Testing the training for language: %s\u0026#34; % language) pred = pipeline.predict(msg_train) logger.debug(\u0026#34;Accuracy with train data\u0026#34;) logger.debug(\u0026#34;%s\u0026#34; % classification_report(label_train, pred)) logger.debug(\u0026#34;Confusion Matrix:\\n%s\u0026#34; % confusion_matrix(label_train, pred)) logger.debug(\u0026#34;Accuracy: %s\u0026#34; % accuracy_score(label_train, pred)) pred = pipeline.predict(msg_test) logger.debug(\u0026#34;Accuracy with test data\u0026#34;) logger.debug(\u0026#34;%s\u0026#34; % classification_report(label_test, pred)) logger.debug(\u0026#34;Confusion Matrix:\\n%s\u0026#34; % confusion_matrix(label_test, pred)) accuracy = accuracy_score(label_test, pred) logger.debug(\u0026#34;Accuracy: %s\u0026#34; % accuracy) In short, this loads a know list of messages with spam and ham and divides it to train the model (via the pipeline) and later to test on the test data to check accuracy.\nFor doing so, it also downloads stopwords, which allows to remove junctions from phrases that are usually less meaningful of the message data itself. The process_text function defined in the pipeline is the one that we should write and takes care of removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.\nOf course, training takes a while so it\u0026rsquo;s not something you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing in realtime, but there is where the dill library (that worked better for my use case than pickle) helped me\u0026hellip; Bot trains every day for new language model, stores it on disk, and later is able to restore from disk and directly use it.\nFor saving and restoring we can use something like this:\n# Save trained pipeline with open(pkl_filename, \u0026#34;wb\u0026#34;) as file: dill.dump(pipeline, file) # Restore trained pipeline with open(pkl_filename, \u0026#34;rb\u0026#34;) as file: pipeline = dill.load(file) So, here we\u0026rsquo;ve already all the pieces\u0026hellip;\nWe can train a pipeline with our database of spam We can save and restore a pipeline so that we can do the hard work in easy moments and still have fast results when using it We can report messages as spam manually and perform actions The last piece of glue, was extending the /spam command to also store the message received and marked as spam into the database.\nWith this approach, the bot is able to work on the current existing database to generate a model, and still allow to grow the database with admin-reported spam messages. Those messages will then be used to train the pipeline periodically either as training or test, helping improving and enhancing the detection\nSo the actual behavior is that @redken_bot does:\nChecks new message if a model for that language exists (only saves it when accuracy is 85% or higher) If it\u0026rsquo;s spam, It will show a keyboard to either mark as spam (confirm) or ignore the message Admins can reply with /spam to messages, even if there\u0026rsquo;s no model for that language, helping in creating the database of messages If a message has been marked as spam, either by replying with /spam or by clicking on the button saying that it\u0026rsquo;s spam, the spam process begins: The button is always removed when replying (with the question about spam status) If the message was marked as spam, the original message is removed The user that sent the message, gets added to the database as spammer and then kicked out of the chat The message is stored on the database for future enhancement of the machine language detection. Additionally, I\u0026rsquo;m testing a \u0026lsquo;ham\u0026rsquo; training feature, being fed with regular messages to start building a positive set of messages to compare with.\nI will continue searching for spam databases in other languages to do an initial set, but in the meantime, it will continue only with English.\nNext steps are:\nPromote messages marked as spam on groups into the general list (right now, messages marked as spam will be only stored, but no other work done with them) Once the message is promoted, it would be extracted from the database and put in an external CSV file similar to the SMS collection for the relevant language for future training. Use the list of blocked UID with status global, to warn in groups where that user is in, showing the chance to kick the user. spamcheck set to auto, automatically deletes the spam messages and reports the user, together with previous item, it will also auto-kick users Enjoy and happy filtering!\n","permalink":"https://iranzo.io/blog/2021/06/24/redken-machine-learning-for-spam-detection/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFor some of the telegram groups I\u0026rsquo;m in, I\u0026rsquo;ve been detecting users that after some period of time, just publish spam messages of any topic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many bots for controlling when a user joins, by showing a CAPTCHA that user must resolve (either clicking a button, answering a mathematical operation, inputting a CAPTCHA image text, etc).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome time ago, a colleague was using Machine Learning and I wanted to have a look at it and it would make a good feature to implement.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Redken machine learning for spam detection"},{"content":"Some years ago I started using geo replication to keep a copy of all the pictures, docs, etc\nAfter being using BitTorrent sync and later resilio sync (even if I didn\u0026rsquo;t fully liked the idea of it being not open source), I gave up. My NAS with 16 GB of ram, even if a bit older (HP N54L), seemed not to have enough memory to run it, and was constantly swapping.\nChecking the list of processes pointed to the rslsync process as the culprit, and apparently the cause is the way it handles the files it controls.\nThe problem is that even one file is deleted long ago, rslsync does keep it in the database\u0026hellip; and in memory. After checking with their support (as I had a family license), the workaround was to remove the folder and create a new one, which in parallel meant having to configure it again on all the systems that used for keeping a copy.\nI finally decide to give syncthing another try after years since last evaluation.\nSyncthing is now is covering some of the features I was using with rslsync:\nMulti-master replication Remote encrypted peers Read only peers Multiple folder support In addition, it includes systemd support and it\u0026rsquo;s packaged in the operating system, making it really easy to install and update (´rslsync´ was without updates for almost a year).\nOnly caveat, if using Debian, is to use the repository they provide as the package included in the distribution is really old, causing some issues with the remote encrypted peers.\nFor starting as user the command is very simple:\nsystemctl enable syncthing@user systemctl start syncthing@user Once the process is started, the browser can be pointed locally at http://127.0.0.1:8384 to start configuration:\nIt is recommended to define a GUI username and password for avoiding other users with access to the system from altering the configuration. Once done, we\u0026rsquo;re ready to start adding folders and systems. One difference is that in rslsync having the secret for the key is enough, in syncthing you need to add the hosts in both ways to accept them and be able to share data.\nOne easing feature here is that one host can be configured as presenter which allows other systems to inherit the know list of hosts from the host marked as presenter, making it easier to do the both-ways initial introduction.\nBest outcome, is that the use (or abuse) of RAM has been completely slashed what rslsync was using.\nCurrently, the only issue is that for some computers in the local network the sync was a bit slow (it even got some remote underpowered devices syncing faster than local ones), but some of the copies were fully in synced already.\nHowever, this issue was fixed when updating all the systems to v1.17.0 which included some improvements to the encrypted folders, making all my systems to be perfectly in sync! Bear also in mind that the provided version by the operating system, like the one in Raspbian is really old, and was causing issues with encrypted folders with the systems in fedora\u0026hellip; once all of them were updated, it worked fine (there were messages about encrypted folder being announced but not configured when the Raspbian version was 1.0.0).\nThe web interface is not bad, even if, for what I was used to, it\u0026rsquo;s not showing as much detail about the hosts status at glance, having to open each individual folder to see how it is going, as in the general view, it shows the percentage of completion and the amount of data still missing to be synced.\nEnjoy!

My flat is not that big, but as I had some issues with 2.4Ghz devices like smart power plugs, I decided to go for a second unit of the same router and test the AI-Mesh that was announced by ASUS as the best way to extend coverage.\nUnfortunately, that meant several things:\nWiFi 6 (available only in one of the two 5Ghz channels) was used for linking both AX92 routers, so clients couldn\u0026rsquo;t use it (I only had one laptop that supported it and got an Intel AX200 WiFi card for an older laptop to test it) That still left one 2.4Ghz channel and a 5Ghz channel to provide service to clients, while the WiFi 6 was used for the connection between both APs to provide connectivity The outcome was not good for having spent 400 EUR in WiFi equipment for a 90 m² flat and still have more disconnection issues from devices\u0026hellip; so all came back to where it came from.\nFor some months I was still checking reviews and struggling on how to improve it, it was not like thousand of WiFi devices, but still wanted network to work fine, and the result was that even if the Router was configured to allow more wireless clients, it was not allowing all of them to connect, so when I tried to reconnect a WiFi plug or an old phone that was sitting in a drawer, there was no way to get it working.\nUbiquiti UniFi Later in the year, after speaking with a colleague, he mentioned that he went with UniFi AC-LR (Long Range)\nCheck the parameter values\nRead before you start!!!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not for noobs, requires either using a very simple approach using \u0026lsquo;standalone mode\u0026rsquo; or buying dedicated hardware for running the \u0026lsquo;Controller\u0026rsquo; or running a container on a Raspberry Pi or on your NAS/Computer Configuration is not as easy as other routers In exchange you get:\nComplete monitoring via their tool Configuration is kept at controller, you can add/remove devices and they will get \u0026lsquo;provisioned\u0026rsquo; with the configuration automatically. APs can \u0026lsquo;join\u0026rsquo; over WiFi to generate a network more capable of dealing with failures. APs use a Power Injector to get both data and power, so ideal for placing in the ceiling and just driving a RJ45 wire there. In general my experience was really smooth:\nAC-LR solved my connectivity problems for all the WiFi devices (2.4 and 5Ghz)\nDevices roamed from one AP to another transparently (only one was wired to my ISP router and the other was \u0026rsquo;linking\u0026rsquo; via WiFi)\nContainer installation via linuxserver/unifi-controller container was great:\npodman create --name=UniFi-controller -e PUID=1000 -e PGID=1000 -e MEM_LIMIT=1024M -p 3478:3478/udp -p 10001:10001/udp -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 -p 1900:1900/udp -p 8843:8843 -p 8880:8880 -p 6789:6789 -p 5514:5514 -v /root/data/UniFi:/config:Z --restart unless-stopped linuxserver/UniFi-controller Upgrades for it are also easy: first remove the existing container, then pull a new image and create a new container pointing to the same data folders. All from my Fedora NAS The final setup After some time, still under the evaluation, I experienced sometimes some issues with the AC-LR AP, it was performing fine, but when streaming from the one near my living room from TV (that connected via wireless to the one connected to the router), sometimes Prime Video had some hiccups. With my experience with the ASUS in the past, I decided to return the devices before it was too late and go for the UniFi NanoHD.\nThis device, in comparison, had better throughput in 5Ghz mode (with a bit higher cost than AC-LR), but smaller antennas (LR stands for Long-Range).\nAs I was happy with the UniFi setup, I also got some other hardware:\nUS-Gateway to be directly connected to my router US-8 ports switch to replace a underused 24 ports one 2 NanoHD AP They were connected in the following way:\nDiagram The Controller software is running as a container in the NAS system and manages the full infrastructure.\nI\u0026rsquo;m attaching here some of the pictures of the User Interface. Some of the features I like:\nthe ability to setup a guest portal than can even use \u0026rsquo;tickets\u0026rsquo;, so that you can limit internet access by day you can add/remove devices and they get the configuration from the controller when using the USG, you get extra features like VLAN for isolating network traffic, DHCP server, etc devices can get an alias (instead of mac or given name) from the User Interface, reserve IP address, etc. Devices are running Linux and you can connect to them via SSH Enjoy!

Cluster does use SSL certificates that require validation and might fail if the dates between the systems are not in sync or at least pretty close in time.\nDiagram We\u0026rsquo;ve several components already available in our OpenShift cluster that are very useful:\nMCO allows to define configuration to be applied by role, etc to the nodes chrony is the client/server installed in Red Hat CoreOS images for connecting to an external NTP Server chrony is already being used and configured via MachineConfigs to point to the configured NTP servers. Via a MCO change with a higher number than the prior ones, we can override the chrony.conf file by role, so that masters can set up required steps to serve time to other machines in the network even with external access to upstream servers or local GPS devices.\nWorkers can point to the masters so that those can be in sync via another file or via setting the proper install-config.yaml settings at install time.\nThere are some risks without a proper time sync:\nSystems might be not synced with real clock at all because of no external NTP access and no local time generator attached (like a GPS device). Users might forget to define proper BIOS time on all the systems prior to installation. In regards to system supportability, as applying MCO changes to the cluster and configuring chrony.conf is documented already it should not have a heavy impact on the cluster supportability (check references).\nImplementation First we need an available cluster installed, and remember:\nDefine proper clock/date in each system\u0026rsquo;s BIOS settings or installation will fail. In order to configure the ntp server, we\u0026rsquo;ll make use of the master servers, but we also need to deal with:\nTo allow multiple servers in the network to use the same local configuration and to be synchronized to one another, without confusing clients that poll more than one server, use the orphan option of the local directive which enables the orphan mode. Each server needs to be configured to poll all other servers with local. This ensures that only the server with the smallest reference ID has the local reference active and other servers are synchronized to it. When the server fails, another one will take over.\nIn order to do so, define a sample chrony.conf file:\n# Use public servers from the pool.ntp.org project. # Please consider joining the pool (https://www.pool.ntp.org/join.html). # This file is managed by the machine config operator server master-0.cloud iburst server master-1.cloud iburst server master-2.cloud iburst stratumweight 0 driftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift rtcsync makestep 10 3 bindcmdaddress 127.0.0.1 bindcmdaddress ::1 keyfile /etc/chrony.keys commandkey 1 generatecommandkey noclientlog logchange 0.5 logdir /var/log/chrony # Serve as local NTP server for all clients even if we\u0026#39;re not in sync with upstream: # Allow NTP client access from local network. allow all # Serve time even if not synchronized to a time source. local stratum 3 orphan This file is similar to the standard one but with the added directives at the end to allow all clients to sync time against this and set the local stratum to level 3, so that others can sync from this server.\nAdditionally the orphan option does the following:\nThis option enables a special orphan mode, where sources with stratum equal to the local stratum are assumed to not serve real time. They are ignored unless no other source is selectable and their reference IDs are smaller than the local reference ID.\nThis allows multiple servers in the network to use the same local configuration and to be synchronised to one another, without confusing clients that poll more than one server. Each server needs to be configured to poll all other servers with the local directive.

and \u0026lt;Metal3.io\u0026gt; where some of the below things were applied.\nOne of the goals we had was to streamline the upstream \u0026lt;-\u0026gt; downstream process to keep changes done in the right way: get changes upstream and copy over downstream with minimal changes.\nWe ended up using AsciiDoctor for building the documentation in the same way it\u0026rsquo;s done downstream so it\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of copying over the modules.\nAsciiDoctor can have variables replaced via command line parameters Can reuse the modules combined in different order to build different docs based on conditionals, master files, etc Can output both HTML and PDF format so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to create downloadable guides as well as browse-able ones In addition, as we use GitHub as a backend, we added some GitHub Actions workflows together with Netlify.\nNetlify provides a \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo; service for Open Source projects that allows to \u0026lsquo;render\u0026rsquo; PR\u0026rsquo;s based on the defined scripts, in our case, that means building the documentation website fully for each PR received, so that you can directly see how the changes in a module are rendered in the final book without requiring manual checkout and build of the changes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve added GitHub actions for:\nOn each commit on the main branch, an action that runs Jekyll and a shell script build.sh is executed, this creates: HTML and PDF versions for each release defined in build.sh (we currently build from the same set of modules, the documentation for OpenShift 4.3 up to 4.7 JSON is created based on the documents rendered and stored in a file. Jekyll renders an index.md that loops over the items in the JSON to show the list of available documents. All above are pushed to another branch that is served via HTTP as a webpage using GitHub Pages at https://openshift-kni.github.io/baremetal-deploy/ Additionally: New users are welcomed on their first contribution. Old issues/PR\u0026rsquo;s are tagged and later closed if not updated. Issues are labelled according to target regular expressions. Ansible linting is performed on the Ansible playbooks we use in the repository. Broken links are checked. This whole process has automated our workflow, reducing the time spent on checking changes and by having a live preview of new changes and automatically built PDF versions that can be downloaded and accessed offline for onsite customer visits.\nDiagram Best practices:\nReuse as much as possible and keep the process simple: both for contributors and for reviewers, with this, you\u0026rsquo;re fostering collaboration: This is the way. Use automation wherever is possible, it might make things more complicated (like failing a PR because of a typo), but the end result will be worth it\u0026hellip; if not, you can perform those checks periodically and have extra work to do: automated spelling check website building (with proper tags for SEO, that will help your project to get known) output format creation, etc. If Upstream/Downstream has differences, try to get to a common ground: the less differences between booth, means more effective use of the time on creating new things or improving instead of reconciling changes Be FAST on answering to issues and PR\u0026rsquo;s, people has invested time into raising them (sometimes a bit of research should have avoided it, but many times that means a problem in usability, lack of clarity on the text, etc and instead of just going away, they did they part to raise it). It feels really bad when someone opens an issue or even contributes and gets no response/feedback from project maintainers. And even worse, when other changes get in the way and PR needs to be re-based once and over again instead of being merged.

Python to the rescue As the bot is written in Python, I did a quick search for language detection and found langdetect which is a port of a Java library to Python that can find certain words, etc in the texts and give some hint about the language.\nSo, instead of using the almost-always-empty user defined language for the interface, it started using langdetect for getting the message language based on the text.\nThis of course, solved on of the problems (no-configured language by users), still left the one on the \u0026rsquo;last-language-used\u0026rsquo; and introduced a new one:\nlangdetect does a guess based on common words, accents, characters, etc but it\u0026rsquo;s just that: a guess. The approach then was to use it to calculate averages based on prior count and new value.\nIn this way, the language moved from being just a string to become a dictionary, storing count and lang: % values, for example:\n{ \u0026#34;count\u0026#34;: 272, \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;: 2.2, \u0026#34;es\u0026#34;: 75.36, \u0026#34;it\u0026#34;: 3.74, \u0026#34;ca\u0026#34;: 3.48, \u0026#34;fi\u0026#34;: 2.3, \u0026#34;fr\u0026#34;: 1.64, \u0026#34;pt\u0026#34;: 1.73, \u0026#34;et\u0026#34;: 0.97, \u0026#34;ro\u0026#34;: 0.68, \u0026#34;de\u0026#34;: 1.11, \u0026#34;hr\u0026#34;: 0.68, \u0026#34;sw\u0026#34;: 1.09, \u0026#34;tl\u0026#34;: 0.96, \u0026#34;lt\u0026#34;: 0.68, \u0026#34;sk\u0026#34;: 1.22, \u0026#34;so\u0026#34;: 1.16, \u0026#34;da\u0026#34;: 1.18, \u0026#34;sv\u0026#34;: 0.67, \u0026#34;tr\u0026#34;: 0.58, \u0026#34;hu\u0026#34;: 0.46, \u0026#34;vi\u0026#34;: 0.43, \u0026#34;sl\u0026#34;: 0.41, \u0026#34;no\u0026#34;: 0.37, } This is my status, from 272 messages, the library has detected Spanish 75% of times, plus some other messages. As you might infer, there are lot of languages listed there that I never used, so it\u0026rsquo;s really important to keep this values refreshing with higher message counts.\nFor groups, this becomes even more interesting, as the message languages get updates for each user that speaks in the channel, giving \u0026lsquo;faster\u0026rsquo;, good results on the language being used:\nEnglish group:\n{ \u0026#34;count\u0026#34;: 56, \u0026#34;tr\u0026#34;: 1.79, \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;: 80.36, \u0026#34;da\u0026#34;: 1.79, \u0026#34;af\u0026#34;: 1.79, \u0026#34;sl\u0026#34;: 1.79, \u0026#34;ca\u0026#34;: 1.79, \u0026#34;es\u0026#34;: 1.79, \u0026#34;fi\u0026#34;: 1.79, \u0026#34;nl\u0026#34;: 1.79, \u0026#34;it\u0026#34;: 1.79, \u0026#34;sq\u0026#34;: 1.79, \u0026#34;so\u0026#34;: 1.79, } Spanish group:\n{ \u0026#34;count\u0026#34;: 140, \u0026#34;es\u0026#34;: 61.42, \u0026#34;fi\u0026#34;: 0.68, \u0026#34;ca\u0026#34;: 1.46, \u0026#34;it\u0026#34;: 5.72, \u0026#34;tr\u0026#34;: 0.68, \u0026#34;sw\u0026#34;: 1.46, \u0026#34;pt\u0026#34;: 5.74, \u0026#34;so\u0026#34;: 2.12, \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;: 8.58, \u0026#34;pl\u0026#34;: 0.68, \u0026#34;sv\u0026#34;: 1.48, \u0026#34;hr\u0026#34;: 0.68, \u0026#34;sk\u0026#34;: 0.67, \u0026#34;cy\u0026#34;: 3.58, \u0026#34;tl\u0026#34;: 1.43, \u0026#34;sl\u0026#34;: 0.68, \u0026#34;no\u0026#34;: 1.44, \u0026#34;de\u0026#34;: 0.69, \u0026#34;da\u0026#34;: 0.7, } Of course, before integrating this code into @redken_bot, I did a small program to validate it:\nfrom langdetect import detect import json # Add some sentences to an array to test text = [] text.append( \u0026#34;It could be that your new system is not getting as much throughput to your hard disks as it should be\u0026#34; ) text.append( \u0026#34;Il mio machina e piu veloce\u0026#34;, ) text.append( \u0026#34;Je suis tres desolè\u0026#34;, ) text.append( \u0026#34;El caballo blando de santiago era blanco\u0026#34;, ) text.append( \u0026#34;My tailor is rich\u0026#34;, ) text.append( \u0026#34;En un lugar de la Mancha de cuyo nombre no quiero acordarme\u0026#34;, ) text.append(\u0026#34;Good morning, hello, good morning hello\u0026#34;) text.append( \u0026#34;No es cierto angel de amor que en esta apartada orilla no luce el sol sino brilla\u0026#34; ) text.append(\u0026#34;Tears will be falling under the heavy rain\u0026#34;) text.append(\u0026#34;Que\u0026#39;l heure est il?\u0026#34;) text.append(\u0026#34;Caracol, col col, saca los cuernos al sol\u0026#34;) # Create dictionary empty for this to work language = {} language[\u0026#34;count\u0026#34;] = 0 # Process each line in text for line in text: # As we\u0026#39;ll be iterating later over a dictionary, prepare updates in a different one updates = {} # Detec language in the line received language_code = detect(line) print(\u0026#34; \u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;Processing Line with detected language \u0026#34;, language_code, \u0026#34;|\u0026#34;, line) updates[\u0026#34;count\u0026#34;] = language[\u0026#34;count\u0026#34;] + 1 # Check if we need to add key to language if language_code not in language: print(\u0026#34;New key in language, preparing updates\u0026#34;) # New language % is 100 over the total number of updates received before, so 100% for the first message in a group updates[language_code] = 100 / updates[\u0026#34;count\u0026#34;] # Process each key we already had in language for key in language: # If the new language matches the one detected, give it a 100%, else, 0% , so that we work on % for each language if key == language_code: value = 100 else: value = 0 # As we store message count in the same dictionary, we just skip it if key != \u0026#34;count\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Processing key %s in language for average updates\u0026#34; % key) updates[key] = float( \u0026#34;{0:.2f}\u0026#34;.format( language[key] + ((value - language[key]) / updates[\u0026#34;count\u0026#34;]) ) ) print(\u0026#34;New average: %s for language %s\u0026#34; % (updates[key], key)) print(\u0026#34;Updates: %s\u0026#34; % updates) language.update(updates) print(language) # Validate that final sum of % is close to 100% (consider rounding problems) accum = 0 for key in language: if key != \u0026#34;count\u0026#34;: accum = accum + language[key] print(float(\u0026#34;{0:.2f}\u0026#34;.format(accum))) # Dump the json of the final detected languages print(json.dumps(language)) Which, when executed, gives as final results:\nProcessing Line with detected language fr | Que\u0026#39;l heure est il?

This information is stored in the VMI.status.conditions. Currently, most of the calculation is based on the Access Mode for the VMI volumes but can be based on multiple parameters. For example:\nStatus: Conditions: Status: True Type: LiveMigratable Migration Method: BlockMigration If the VM is Live-Migratable, the request will submit successfully. The status change will be reported under VMI.status. Once live migration is complete, a status of Completed or Failed will be indicated.\nImportant\nThe Migration Method field can contain:\nBlockMigration : meaning that the disk data is being copied from source to destination LiveMigration: meaning that only the memory is copied from source to destination VMs with block devices located on shared storage backends like the ones provided by Rook that provide PVCs with ReadWriteMany access have the option to live-migrate only memory contents instead of having to also migrate the block devices.\nCancelling a Live Migration If we want to abort the Live Migration, \u0026lsquo;Kubernetes-Style\u0026rsquo;, we\u0026rsquo;ll just delete the object we created for triggering it.\nIn this case, the VM status for migration will report some additional information:\nMigration State: Abort Requested: true Abort Status: Succeeded Completed: true End Timestamp: 2019-03-29T04:02:49Z Failed: true Migration Config: Completion Timeout Per GiB: 800 Progress Timeout: 150 Migration UID: 57a693d6-51d7-11e9-b370-525500d15501 Source Node: node02 Start Timestamp: 2019-03-29T04:02:47Z Target Direct Migration Node Ports: 39445: 0 43345: 49152 44222: 49153 Target Node: node01 Target Node Address: 10.128.0.46 Target Node Domain Detected: true Target Pod: virt-launcher-testvmimcbjgw6zrzcmp8wpddvztvzm7x2k6cjbdgktwv8tkq Note that there are some additional fields that indicate that Abort Requested happened and in the above example that it has Succeded, in this case, the original fields for migration will report as Completed (because there\u0026rsquo;s no running migration) and Failed set to true.\nWhat can go wrong? Live-migration is a complex process that requires transferring data from one \u0026lsquo;VM\u0026rsquo; in one node to another \u0026lsquo;VM\u0026rsquo; into another one, this requires that the activity of the VM being live-migrated to be compatible with the network configuration and throughput so that all the data can be migrated faster than the data is changed at the original VM, this is usually referred to as converging.\nSome values can be adjusted (check the table for settings that can be tuned), to allow it to succeed but as a trade-off:\nIncreasing the number of VMs that can migrate at once, will reduce the available bandwidth. Increasing the bandwidth could affect applications running on that node (origin and target). Storage migration (check the Info note in the Performing the Live Migration section on the differences) might also consume bandwidth and resources. Node Eviction Sometimes, a node requires to be put on maintenance and it includes workloads on it, either containers or, in KubeVirt\u0026rsquo;s case, VM\u0026rsquo;s.\nIt is possible to use selectors, for example, move all the virtual machines to another node via kubectl drain \u0026lt;nodename\u0026gt;, for example, evicting all KubeVirt VM\u0026rsquo;s from a node can be done via:\nkubectl drain \u0026lt;node name\u0026gt; --delete-local-data --ignore-daemonsets=true --force --pod-selector=kubevirt.io=virt-launcher Reenabling node after eviction\nOnce the node has been tainted for eviction, we can use kubectl uncordon \u0026lt;nodename\u0026gt; to make it schedulable again.\nAccording to documentation, --delete-local-data, --ignore-daemonsets and --force are required because:\nPods using emptyDir can be deleted because the data is ephemeral. VMI will have DaemonSets via virt-handler so it\u0026rsquo;s safe to proceed. VMIs are not owned by a ReplicaSet or DaemonSet, so kubectl can\u0026rsquo;t guarantee that those are restarted. KubeVirt has its own controllers for it managing VMI, so kubectl shouldn\u0026rsquo;t bother about it. If we omit the --pod-selector, we\u0026rsquo;ll force eviction of all Pods and VM\u0026rsquo;s from a node.\nImportant\nIn order to have VMIs using LiveMigration for eviction, we have to add a specific spec in the VMI YAML, so that when the node is tainted with kubevirt.io/drain:NoSchedule is added to a node.\nspec: evictionStrategy: LiveMigrate From that point, when kubectl taint nodes \u0026lt;foo\u0026gt; kubevirt.io/drain=draining:NoSchedule is executed, the migrations will start.\nConclusion As a briefing on the above data:\nLiveMigrate needs to be enabled on KubeVirt as a feature gate. LiveMigrate will add status to the VMI object indicating if it\u0026rsquo;s a candidate or not and if so, which mode to use (Block or Live) Based on the storage backend and other conditions, it will enable LiveMigration or just BlockMigration.

to the repository (and we still could revert back), make sure you\u0026rsquo;re testing on a repository suitable before doing this on valuable data.\nThen, I wanted to remove the \u0026lsquo;problematic commit\u0026rsquo; by running:\ngit rebase -i HEAD~20 In that way, git offers you an editor with the latest 20 commits in the branch so that you can elect to \u0026lsquo;drop\u0026rsquo; the ones that are problematic, in this case the one from the presentation.\nTo do so, go to the line describing the commit of the presentation and change pick to d and when the editor saves the changes and exits, the git history will be rewritten and the files dropped.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve done that only in a new branch, so the original branch with the code (source in my case), still contains the presentation.\nTo rewrite the history and have the presentation in the end, we need to:\ngit checkout source git rebase -f branchwithoutpresentation Above command will rewrite \u0026lsquo;source\u0026rsquo; commits to be \u0026lsquo;on top\u0026rsquo; of the branchwithoutpresentation branch (the one without the presentation), leaving us with all the commits ordered, and in the last one, the presentation itself.\nThis allowed me to continue editing the last commit (git commit --amend --no-edit) adding or removing files always on the same commit, so once the big files where uploaded to YouTube, I could just drop them from the repository leaving it clean again.\nHowever, this means that the commits where altered in order, being the latest one, a commit \u0026lsquo;dated\u0026rsquo; earlier, of course, the end results didn\u0026rsquo;t changed, but wanted my git history to look \u0026rsquo;linear\u0026rsquo;, so I did the following procedure to \u0026lsquo;insert\u0026rsquo; the commit back where it belonged:\ngit log # to get list of commits (write down the commit number for the presentation) # also, write down the commit \u0026#39;after\u0026#39; the presentation should be inserted git checkout -b sortedbranch commitafterthepresentationshouldbeinserted git cherry-pick commitnumberofthepresentation git checkout source # to get back to the regular branch git rebase -f sortedbranch At this point, the remaining commits of the source branch were added on top of sortedbranch, leaving us in a ordered git log and in this case, without the big files in the repository.\nDanger\nAt this point, a simple git push will not allow you to update your upstream repository as the history is not linear (from their point of view), so a git push --force is needed to overwrite remote repository with local changes. This is destructive if others have made changes on the repository, so be really sure about what you do before doing it.\nHappy git playing!\n","permalink":"https://iranzo.io/blog/2020/02/13/git-commit-reordering/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhile I was working for a presentation for kid\u0026rsquo;s school at \u003ca href=\"%22campo-magnetico-auroras-fases-lunares-cohetes.md%22\"\u003eMagnetic field, Aurora, Lunar Phases and Rockets\u003c/a\u003e, I added 4 big videos to the presentation (as I was going to use them offline while presenting).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what git is not the place for big binary files, and even Github proposed to use the LFS backend for that, but as it was just temporary, I went ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that commit, I also wrote two more articles, the one on \u003ca href=\"/blog/2020/02/08/lego-speed-champions-2020-review/\"\u003eLego Speed Champions\u003c/a\u003e and the one on \u003ca href=\"/blog/2020/02/12/galleria.io-and-photoswipe/\"\u003eGalleria.io and PhotoSwipe\u003c/a\u003e, so it became a problem to have big files in between, when my plan was to remove them in the end.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Git commit reordering"},{"content":"Introduction I was looking for an alternative for my (this) blog and hold pictures.

Using it, I was able to then consider using some Gallery Software to get them rendered.\nGalleria.io https://galleria.io offers a nice gallery, which uses jQuery and also accepts a json as input, so it was more or less straightforward to convert from the json from Instagram to what Galleria.io required.\nI used that to get an initial draft to be added to Pelican-Elegant, but as the goal in the project is to remove dependency on jQuery it was discarded.\nHowever, my personal research came part of another website that even not directly from Instagram, takes a good advantage of defining a json of images for showcasing pictures.\nPhotoSwipe While discussing about Galleria, Talha from Pelican-Elegant found two other projects and it was decided that PhotoSwipe provided nice features, mobile usage like pinch-in and pinch-out.\nPhotoSwipe required extra steps like creating a div and using HTML tags for putting pics (check the official documentation for Pelican-Elegant Galleries)\nOne of the main problems was getting image size required (Galleria.io didn\u0026rsquo;t required it), but when using Instagram pictures we can grab the information from the JSON.\nFinally with the help from Talha, we got it also working with Instagram Gallery Embed Instagram Post\nEnjoy!

Please, read gspread documentation on requisites and steps for obtaining this file.\nOnce the file is there, the code can be as easy as:\nimport os import gspread from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials # use creds to create a client to interact with the Google Drive API scope = [ \u0026#34;https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive\u0026#34;, ] creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name( os.environ[\u0026#34;GACREDENTIALS\u0026#34;], scope ) client = gspread.authorize(creds) # Find a workbook by name and open the first sheet # Make sure you use the right name here. sheet = client.open(\u0026#34;My spreadsheet\u0026#34;).sheet1 # Extract and print all of the values records = sheet.get_all_records() for record in records: if record[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;] != \u0026#34;\u0026#34;: dosomething() In this case, we access the file via the file pointed in GACREDENTIALS environment variable and use the scope for defining the access level we need for this file.\nIn this case, the spreadsheet was shared with \u0026lsquo;viewer\u0026rsquo; permissions to the system account created for the credentials and stored in the file on disk.\nThis enabled us to iterate over the elements and parse the rows in the sheet for doing or \u0026lsquo;ICS\u0026rsquo; dump to file, using specific column for each item (start date, end date, description, location, name, etc)\nThe generated ICS file could be stored in an accessible Webserver for subscribing to it, or we could manually import the events into our calendar.\nThis solution, however, created duplicates of entries on each import, as the walk process just recreated all the entries on each execution.\nAs a next-step, it was considered to directly write them to Google calendar so that the file itself could be created and stored but the actual event check happening via regular calendaring app.\nAccessing Google Calendar Access to Google calendar required to setup another method for accessing via using the standard Google API for Python. This required to setup credentials for OAUTH app, with a \u0026lsquo;portal\u0026rsquo; to grant access to a user, which writes a token to disk that can later be used for accessing the service.\nAs we\u0026rsquo;re reading always from the same Google Sheet, we wanted to first cleanup the older entries, so we used the following code (taken from: https://karenapp.io/articles/2019/07/how-to-automate-google-calendar-with-python-using-the-calendar-api/):\nimport os import os.path import pickle import sys import dateutil.parser import gspread from google.auth.transport.requests import Request from googleapiclient.discovery import build from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials # If modifying these scopes, delete the file token.pickle.

It maintains an inventory of available hosts as instances of the BareMetalHost Custom Resource Definition.

Provision hosts with a desired image Clean a host\u0026rsquo;s disk contents before or after provisioning.\nA bit more in deep approach The Baremetal Operator (BMO) keeps a mapping of each host and its management interfaces (vendor based like iLO, iDrac, iRMC, etc) and controlled via IPMI.\nAll of this is defined in a CRD, for example:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: metal3-node01-credentials namespace: metal3 type: Opaque data: username: YWRtaW4= password: YWRtaW4= --- apiVersion: metal3.io/v1alpha1 kind: BareMetalHost metadata: name: metal3-node01 namespace: metal3 spec: bmc: address: ipmi://172.22.0.2:6230 credentialsName: metal3-node01-credentials bootMACAddress: 00:c2:fc:3b:e1:01 description: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;

for each slide, this however had some cons/pros:\nPros: Format was kept almost 100% Easy to showcase with any \u0026lsquo;gallery\u0026rsquo; plugin Cons: Text was lost, so no links, no indexation, etc Alternatively, I could add and attach via a link to the odp file for end users to download and reproduce, but that will increase blog size (no constrains, but sounded like nonsense to me), so I continued my research for a solution or workaround to use.\nThe approach Thanks to https://github.com/cliffe/AwesomeSlides, which uses perl and a set of common available libraries on any distribution to do the job, I was able to convert my presentations from odp to html quite easily:\nfor file in *.odp; do perl convert-to-awesome.pl $file done This resulted in \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; html files in the slides_out folder, plus a folder containing the images and other media used by the presentation.\nAwesomeSlides does the conversion to \u0026lsquo;revealjs\u0026rsquo; format, plus adds extra features, transitions, etc to make them fancier, but in my case I was interested in plain markdown, so the next one to the rescue has been pandoc\nfor file in *.html; do pandoc -t markdown $file -o $file.md done The end result of course is not clean at all and not directly usable by the pelican plugin to render the images, etc.\nThe post-processing One of the things needed (and that I used for other slides) is to move the resulting md file to the same folder as the images and move them into the content/presentations folder of my website source.\nOnce there, a set of find/replacements was required:\nfind replacement description $folder `` Define images included as `` for pelican to pick them up \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash; Remove underlining after titles stangechars normalchar Some characters were lost (accents, etc), replaced by another one, to later spell check \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n Remove extra new lines -⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ -⠀ Remove extra spaces before paragraph Other manual steps involved\nPut ## in front of each title Adjust empty slides (\u0026mdash; followed by another \u0026mdash;) And a lot more :-) The good thing, in the end, is that with some additional work, I was able to bring back \u0026lsquo;online\u0026rsquo; my older presentations, now listed in the presentations category.

When also tried to use a newer pandoc version, the results were even worse.\nFinally, I dissected what I wanted from pypandoc module, and instead of using it, went to directly use the same shell command I was using.\nAs the templates for the rendered the pages should be similar, I moved to use the \u0026rsquo;non-standalone\u0026rsquo; version of pandoc conversion, hence, instead of generating full html, I could reuse headers, css loading, etc and just put the content relevant for the slides, and at the same time, reuse article metadata like article.title, author, date to fill some values in the rendered html.\nThis also, rendered in two outcomes, 2nd patch was no longer needed in that form, and some other dependencies were removed (no more pypandoc, no more BeautifulSoup, etc)\nThe new version of the plugin has been contributed via PR, but while it is being accepted by original author, you can find the relevant version in the \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; branch of https://github.com/iranzo/pelican-revealmd.\nOutcomes This of course, has brought some outcomes:\nMy blog can now render my reveal-md slides stored as filename.revealjs I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a bit on how Pelican plugins work Blog-o-Matic has been updated to include that support too, out of the box Enjoy!

Investigation We started to investigate how others approached this situation and similar to what was done for another part of the setup for MongoDB, we went testing via replication over SSL.\nWe also checked several of the approaches, but one of them, PostDock images were lacking SSL support, but still had a nice way to do several overrides for configuration, etc via environment variables, which made them ideal for testing in an OpenShift/Kubernetes environment.\nThe environments we plan to use are:\nAIT cluster LEO cluster PIT cluster SSL For the SSL setup side we did:\nCreate Postgres Certs Seems that Postgres doesn\u0026rsquo;t check the certificate for the host \u0026lsquo;by default\u0026rsquo;, but just uses the certificate to encrypt, but still we did create the certificates using the name of the application in it for future usage.\nUsing the same certificate with all server names, we can also federate a single secret containing those certs rather than creating one SSL secret for each cluster.\n./generate-cert.sh postgres With output:\n2018/11/29 15:04:29 [INFO] generate received request 2018/11/29 15:04:29 [INFO] received CSR 2018/11/29 15:04:29 [INFO] generating key: rsa-2048 2018/11/29 15:04:29 [INFO] encoded CSR 2018/11/29 15:04:29 [INFO] signed certificate with serial number 34111709152443674697969629831350216041253590538 Now, we do have all the required certificates for postgres generated.\n-rw-r--r--. 1 iranzo iranzo 1001 nov 29 15:04 postgres.csr -rw-rw-r--. 1 iranzo iranzo 208 nov 29 15:04 postgres-csr.json -rw-------. 1 iranzo iranzo 1679 nov 29 15:04 postgres-key.pem -rw-rw-r--. 1 iranzo iranzo 1753 nov 29 15:04 postgres.pem Our setup configuration Setup:\nLEO will be the \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo;

The bittersweet wrap-up At this point we do have the postgres image started with SSL, however:\nIn order to use replication between environments, we need a way to access postgres The creation and configuration of SSL setup gets us a bit closer to it OpenShift HAPROXY requires SNI-capable client, which is not1 the case, hence we still cannot have the traffic get into the postgres instance and hence, replication doesn\u0026rsquo;t start as there\u0026rsquo;s no communication. All attempts to use a router (that only permits http and https or TLS-with-SNI) failed completely, as PSQL doesn\u0026rsquo;t yet have the support in place, failed, even some other hacks on initialization scripts to use the alternate port instead.\nUnfortunately, this became a major blocker at this time, not allowing us to setup a replicated postgres cluster across different OpenShift Clusters to have it as a database we can rely for setting up Quay on top.\nThe plot twist After finding no more ways, we discussed with our team members for putting more brains in this, and in conversations with Pep, Mario and Ryan, it was suggested to instead use a LoadBalancer IP, that imposes no restrictions on the traffic, this however could only be accomplished on 3 environments (LEO, AIT and AWS)\nAs AWS seems to have no DNS resolution, we\u0026rsquo;re limited to use IP\u0026rsquo;s in the server name (for the CLUSTER_NODE_NETWORK_NAME) so that in case of failover, AWS can reach them.\nWith the current setup, we only needed to define \u0026lsquo;persistent\u0026rsquo; storage for postgres so in case all three pods were destroyed at the same time, we do have some data to start over.\nThe final steps, outlined above in Our setup configuration, were updated to use:\nPARTNER_NODES containing the LB IP address for the Load Balancer defined in each environment EXCEPT our own\nCLUSTER_NODE_NETWORK_NAME: our LB IP as it would go in PARTNER_NODES for other clusters\nPARTNER_NODES: IP\u0026rsquo;s of: postgres-leo.apps.e2e.bos.example.com,postgres-ait.apps.e2e.bos.example.com,postgres-aws.apps.e2e.bos.example.com (from below, but EXCLUDING the one we\u0026rsquo;re that we\u0026rsquo;ll be putting in CLUSTER_NODE_NETWORK_NAME)\nLEO: 10.19.227.153 AIT: 10.19.115.226 AWS: internal-aba91353afe1c11e89f350a50403e669-443870799.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com NODE_ID: $(NUMBER DIFFERENT FOR EACH NODE + 1000, f.e. 1002)\nCLUSTER_NODE_NETWORK_NAME: $(SAME AS NODE_NAME that would go in PARTNER NODES)\nREPLICATION_HOST: \u0026ldquo;postgres\u0026rdquo; (name of app in deployment)\nWith this approach, the LoadBalancer effectively passes the data on port 5432 (even if it\u0026rsquo;s not SSL), and the cluster can form and start replication of data.\nSo next steps are:\nDefine DNS name pointing to all 3 IP\u0026rsquo;s that we can configure on apps Rely on psql standby to work in read-only mode and providing service Setup Quay to use that psql DNS name Automate the setup, including Quay ENV variable for storage \u0026lsquo;closer\u0026rsquo; to each cluster.

For Federation of OpenShift/Kubernetes clusters we want not only to demo some applications, but build a solution that covers all that will be needed in a real-world deployment.\nColleagues in the Solutions Engineering team have been working on demonstrating an application running on different clusters over a Federated Control Plane, allowing it to \u0026lsquo;roam\u0026rsquo; between clusters with shared data access as a way to demonstrate how an application can \u0026lsquo;scale\u0026rsquo; from on-premise deployment to external clouds in order to satisfy business requirements for peak demands.\nThis article tries to demonstrate on how to setup Quay, as a container registry for your applications, in a way that can work both for this Federated approach as well as High-Availability setup.\nWhat is Quay? The one liner would be: Quay is a container registry.\nThe extended one, would be more in the lines of:\nQuay is a container registry that can be used via the provided service at https://quay.io or can be used via Quay Enterprise as \u0026lsquo;on premise\u0026rsquo; registry.\nA container registry provides a point for containers to be downloaded or uploaded for later consumption.\nWhy quay? Quay allows to be configured either to use the provided service via https://quay.io or deploy it on premise, so that you gain additional control over the setup like which namespaces to replicate, policies, etc.\nQuay features clair analysis of images, allowing to detect known vulnerabilities from different sources to later check the images.\nAlso, allows to automate builds when a push to a repository has happened, allowing to quickly spawn an update container image when our tracked repository has a new commit that can be later updated in our OpenShift/Kubernetes image stream.\nQuay can also, when having several storage backends defined, do geo-replication, that allows OpenShift to grab the needed bytes from the closest backend while handling in the background the copy of new data to the other replicas.\nWhat is Swift? Swift is object storage provided by OpenStack Environment, defined at https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift as:\nThe OpenStack Object Store project, known as Swift, offers cloud storage software so that you can store and retrieve lots of data with a simple API. It\u0026rsquo;s built for scale and optimized for durability, availability, and concurrency across the entire data set. Swift is ideal for storing unstructured data that can grow without bound.\nSwift allows to define a container (not in the https://www.opencontainers.org/ sense but in a \u0026lsquo;data storage\u0026rsquo;).\nHow does it come to play with Quay? Quay allows to define storage backend based on swift that can be used together with other backends to provide geo-replication for availability.\nThe Setup process of Swift for Quay At the beginning it was not easy to find out all the required configuration variables or settings to define, but what finally worked for the setup described in this article was:\nCreate the Swift container First we do need to create a swift container in OpenStack that will hold the information from Quay:\nCreate swift container for holding the storage:\n(overcloud) [stack@osp-ait-director ~]$ openstack container create quay-enterprise Output: account container x-trans-id AUTH_b3b8ce2eca3c4556ac01c12772b0d141 quay-enterprise txd7d654f499db457da0fa0-005bf53d32 Configuration settings defined in Quay Setting Value Storage Engine OpenStack Storage (Swift) Swift Auth Version 3 Swift Auth URL \\$YOURKEYSTONE PUBLIC ENDPOINT (like http://aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd:5000) Swift container name \\$YOURCONTAINER (created with swift container create \u0026rsquo;name\u0026rsquo;) Storage path \\$WHATEVER (we did use /quay) Username \\$OSP_USERNAME (we did use admin) key/password \\$OSP_PASSWORD(we did use redhat) OS OPTIONS drop-down \u0026lt;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash; This is an important one if not it will fail tenant_id \\$YOURTENANTID (I did use \u0026lsquo;admin\u0026rsquo; id as obtained with openstack project list|grep admin) Once done, Quay should \u0026lsquo;validate\u0026rsquo; the upload and swift list $YOURCONTAINER should give something like:\n(overcloud) [stack@osp-director ~]$ swift list quay-enterprise quay/_verify Showing that the verification file has been created succesfully.\nGeoreplication Quay allows to define several backends that can be also configured as a foundation for GeoReplication.\nGeoreplication in quay, is used to:\ndefine a \u0026lsquo;zone name\u0026rsquo; for a storage backend when booting Quay containers or apps, define which backend is \u0026lsquo;closest\u0026rsquo; (via environment variable QUAY_DISTRIBUTED_STORAGE_PREFERENCE) Quay will store and replicate on the different backends defined the information uploaded. The requirement is that the backend is an object storage, but you can also define \u0026lsquo;mixed\u0026rsquo; backends like for example GCE, AWS, Swift, Ceph RadosGW, etc. Quay will take care of the copy and once the backend \u0026lsquo;closest\u0026rsquo; to the quay instance is ready, it will serve from that one (or fallback to the one having the actual data).\nFor each one of the configured backends, a different number of settings will be requested to do the proper configuration.\nGoogle Cloud Storage For setting Google Cloud Storage, we did use the following values:\nSetting Value Location ID $yourvalue Storage Engine Google Cloud Storage Cloud Access Key GOOGXXXXXXXX Cloud Secret Key pksXXXXXX GCS Bucket quay-enterprise Storage Directory /datastorage/registry Amazon S3 For setting Amazon S3 storage, we did use the following values:\nSetting Value Location ID $yourvalue Storage Engine Amazon S3 S3 Bucket quay-enterprise Storage Directory /quay/ait AWS Access Key AKIAXXXXXXXX AWS Secret Key /9bkfXXXXXXXXXX Validation of the replication Once all the defined storage backends have been configured, there\u0026rsquo;s a button in the interface that will validate access and create the \u0026lsquo;marker\u0026rsquo; files on each storage backend to verify the access permissions to them similar to what was shown on Swift configuration.\nQuay SSL deployment This procedure will guide you through the configuration of Quay with SSL certificates so the deployment is both secure and deployed in a highly available enterprise way.\nSSL Certificates Setting up certificates requires several steps involving:\nCreating a CA Create a Certificate Signing Request with all the possible quay hostnames Sign the certificates Upload the certificates on Quay Create CA Execution of generate-ca.sh\n./generate-ca.sh With output:\n2018/11/29 15:01:13 [INFO] generating a new CA key and certificate from CSR 2018/11/29 15:01:13 [INFO] generate received request 2018/11/29 15:01:13 [INFO] received CSR 2018/11/29 15:01:13 [INFO] generating key: rsa-2048 2018/11/29 15:01:13 [INFO] encoded CSR 2018/11/29 15:01:13 [INFO] signed certificate with serial number 432855461933024796113382064222588753737107796958 And creates:\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 iranzo iranzo 232 nov 29 15:01 ca-config.json -rw-r--r--. 1 iranzo iranzo 1001 nov 29 15:01 ca.csr -rw-rw-r--. 1 iranzo iranzo 208 nov 29 15:01 ca-csr.json -rw-------. 1 iranzo iranzo 1679 nov 29 15:01 ca-key.pem -rw-rw-r--. 1 iranzo iranzo 1359 nov 29 15:01 ca.pem Create Quay Certs We are going to use the same certificate for each replica, we need to know the hostname that will be used on the OCP routes beforehand in order to use it for the SAN property in the certificate.\nHaving each of the routes in the SAN makes it possible to use the same cert for each replica, so we can federate a single secret containing those certs rather than creating one SSL secret for each cluster.\nExecution of generate-cert.sh\n./generate-cert.sh quay-enterprise With output:\n2018/11/29 15:01:26 [INFO] generate received request 2018/11/29 15:01:26 [INFO] received CSR 2018/11/29 15:01:26 [INFO] generating key: rsa-2048 2018/11/29 15:01:26 [INFO] encoded CSR 2018/11/29 15:01:26 [INFO] signed certificate with serial number 570248288515480165542553575432827729263232937534 Now, we have all the required certificates for Quay generated.\n-rw-r--r--. 1 iranzo iranzo 1001 nov 29 15:01 quay-enterprise.csr -rw-rw-r--. 1 iranzo iranzo 208 nov 29 15:01 quay-enterprise-csr.json -rw-------. 1 iranzo iranzo 1675 nov 29 15:01 quay-enterprise-key.pem -rw-rw-r--. 1 iranzo iranzo 1809 nov 29 15:01 quay-enterprise.pem Load Quay certificates Now using the web interface of quay, we can start uploading the certificates required for operation.\nCustom SSL Certificates Here, load the quay.pem\nServer Configuration **TLS** Certificate: load the quay-enterprise.pem Key: load the quay-enterprise-key.pem\nAt this point Quay will be using the certificates, but by default the service created only works on port 80.\nREMEMBER: We\u0026rsquo;ll need to edit:\nthe app the route So that both work on port 443 instead of port 80 that is used by default.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll also need to load ca.pem and quay-enterprise.pem into our /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors folder and then run:\nupdate-ca-trust extract service docker restart # Now let\u0026#39;s go login into the registry docker login https://quay-enterprise-quay-enterprise.apps.leo-fed.e2e.bos.example.com # Let\u0026#39;s download a container: docker pull quay.io/mavazque/pacman # let\u0026#39;s tag and upload to our registry docker images|grep pacman quay.io/mavazque/pacman latest 6c5211874850 29 hours ago 689 MB # Tag and upload # Find image docker images|grep pacman quay.io/mavazque/pacman latest 6c5211874850 29 hours ago 689 MB # Tag image docker tag 6c5211874850 quay-enterprise-quay-enterprise.apps.leo-fed.e2e.bos.example.com/admin/pacman:latest # Upload image docker push quay-enterprise-quay-enterprise.apps.leo-fed.e2e.bos.example.com/admin/pacman The push refers to a repository [quay-enterprise-quay-enterprise.apps.leo-fed.e2e.bos.example.com/admin/pacman] fb2d3be23d30: Pushed c02d067bd364: Pushed 3edd111b03f2: Pushed 2221babd26ac: Pushed 911d290ce59f: Pushed fae583f1d4e5: Pushed 9d22e51f0c6d: Pushed 58b8d417193d: Pushing [===================================\u0026gt;

One of the key pieces is a properly configured .travis.yaml like the one we started using:\nlanguage: python dist: trusty sudo: required python: - \u0026#34;3.5\u0026#34; before_install: - pip install -U pip - pip install -U setuptools - pip install -r requirements.txt - pip install -r test-requirements.txt - pip install peru - peru sync - pip install tox script: - tox - make html after_success: - rm -rf .git/ - git init - git config user.name \u0026#34;Travis CI\u0026#34; - git config user.email \u0026#34;travis@domain.com\u0026#34; - git config --global push.default simple - git remote add origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/Pelican-Elegant/pelican-elegant.github.io.git - make github Image setup So, from above file we do:\nlanguage: python dist: trusty sudo: required python: - \u0026#34;3.5\u0026#34; Configure language as Python Select distribution Confirm we require sudo access Configure Python version as 3.5 All of this depends on Travis Image being used and their documentation\nPreparation of environment Now, we\u0026rsquo;ll prepare the environment for our tests:\nbefore_install: - pip install -U pip - pip install -U setuptools - pip install -r requirements.txt - pip install -r test-requirements.txt - pip install peru - peru sync - pip install tox We do install pip, setuptools, repository and test requirements, peru and tox.\nPeru is used to grab additional dependencies for Elegant (plugins, latest theme, etc)\nActual tests This is really easy in our case:\nscript: - tox - make html We run \u0026rsquo;tox\u0026rsquo; that allows to automate Python virtualenv and tests and then, use the Makefile from Pelican to build the site and tests plugins, etc\nIf everything succeeds, we\u0026rsquo;re ready for the next step (publishing)\nAfter tests passed All the environment setup and tests have succeed now, we do need to push the site \u0026rsquo;live'\nafter_success: - rm -rf .git/ - git init - git config user.name \u0026#34;Travis CI\u0026#34; - git config user.email \u0026#34;travis@domain.com\u0026#34; - git config --global push.default simple - git remote add origin https://${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/Pelican-Elegant/pelican-elegant.github.io.git - make github This piece does the final step, first removes info about the repository containing the actual documentation and allows us to initialize a new one, that we make it point towards the repository we\u0026rsquo;re pushing (so that we keep separate actual website content from \u0026lsquo;rendered\u0026rsquo; website).\nIn the final step, \u0026lsquo;make github\u0026rsquo; uses the makefile provided with pelican to push the changes to the \u0026lsquo;master\u0026rsquo; branch of the target repository, that then, is ready to be served via github pages as a regular web server would do.\nWrap up So, right now we\u0026rsquo;ve accomplished several things:\nWe do use pelican in the same way that we\u0026rsquo;ll do for our own website We do also have as a consequence, a \u0026rsquo;live\u0026rsquo; demo of latest master branch showcasing features We did automate publishing of webpage as soon as contributors send new articles and are approved for merge All requires no extra change to regular workflow as \u0026lt;Travis-ci.org\u0026gt; is the glue here putting together all the pieces.

Infrastructure should be able to test it (for example you might need some specific hardware to test a card or network configuration) Environment should be sane so that prior runs doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the validation. OSP CI can be checked at \u0026lsquo;Zuul\u0026rsquo; http://zuul.openstack.org/ where you can \u0026lsquo;input\u0026rsquo; the number for your review and see how the different bots are running CI tests on it or if it\u0026rsquo;s still queued.\nIf everything is OK, the bot will \u0026lsquo;vote\u0026rsquo; your change as Verified +1 allowing others to see that it should not break anything based on the tests performed\nIn the case of OSP, there\u0026rsquo;s also third-party CI\u0026rsquo;s that can validate other changes by third party systems. For some of them, the votes are counting towards or against the proposed change, for others it\u0026rsquo;s just a comment to take into account.\nEven if sometimes you know that your code is right, there\u0026rsquo;s a failure because of the infrastructure, in those cases, writing a new comment saying recheck, will schedule a new CI test run.\nThis is common usually during busy periods when it\u0026rsquo;s harder for the scheduler to get available resources for the review validation. Also, sometimes there are errors in the configuration of CI that must be fixed in order to validate those changes.\nNote: you can run some of the tests on your system to validate faster if you\u0026rsquo;ve issues by running tox this will setup virtual environment for tests to be run so it\u0026rsquo;s easier to catch issues before upstream CI does (so it\u0026rsquo;s always a good idea to run tox even before submitting the review with git-review to detect early errors).\nThis is however not always possible as some changes include requirements like testing upgrades, full environment deployments, etc that cannot be done without the required preparation steps or even the infrastructure.\nCode Review+2 This is probably the \u0026rsquo;longest\u0026rsquo; process, it requires peers to be added as \u0026lsquo;reviewer\u0026rsquo; (you can get an idea on the names based on other reviews submitted for the same component) or they will pick up new reviews as the pop un on notification channels or pending queues.\nOn this, you must prepare mentally for everything\u0026hellip; developers could suggest to use a different approach, or highlight other problems or just do some small nit comments to fixes like formating, spacing, var naming, etc.\nAfter each comment/change suggested, repeat the workflow for submitting a new patchset, but make sure you\u0026rsquo;re using the same review id (that\u0026rsquo;s by keeping the commit id that is appended): this allows the Code Review platform to identify this change as an update to a prior one, and allow you for example to compare changes across versions, etc. (and also notify the prior reviewers of new changes).\nOnce reviewers are OK with your code, and with some \u0026lsquo;Core\u0026rsquo; developers also agreeing, you\u0026rsquo;ll see some voting happening (-2..+2) meaning they like the change in its actual form or not.\nOnce you get Code Review +2 and with the prior Verified +1 you\u0026rsquo;re almost ready to get the change merged.\nWorkflow+1 Ok, last step is to have someone with Workflow permissions to give a +1, this will \u0026lsquo;seal\u0026rsquo; the change saying that everything is ok (as it had CR+2 and Verified+1) and change is valid\u0026hellip;\nThis vote will trigger another build by CI, and when finished, the change will be merged into the code upstream, congratulations!\nCannot merge, please rebase Sometimes, your change is doing changes on the same files that other programmers did on the code, so there\u0026rsquo;s no way to automatically \u0026lsquo;rebase\u0026rsquo; the change, in this case the bad news is that you need to:\ngit checkout master # to change to master branch git pull # to push latest upstream changes git checkout yourbranch # to get back to your change branch git rebase master # to apply your changes on top of current master After this step, it might be required to manually fix the code to solve the conflicts and follow instructions given by git to mark them as reviewed.\nOnce it\u0026rsquo;s done, remember to do like with any patchset you submitted afterwards:\ngit commit --amend # to commit the new changes on the same commit Id you used git-review # to upload a new version of the patchset This will start over the progress, but will, once completed to get the change merged.\nHow do we do it with Citellus? In Citellus we\u0026rsquo;ve replicated more or less what we\u0026rsquo;ve upstream\u0026hellip; even the use of tox.\nCitellus does use https://gerrithub.io (free service that hooks on github and allows to do PR)\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve setup a machine that runs Jenkins to do \u0026lsquo;CI\u0026rsquo; on the tests we\u0026rsquo;ve defined (mostly for python wrapper and some tests) and what effectively does is to run tox, and also, we do use https://travis-ci.org free Tier to repeat the same on other platform.\ntox is a tool that allows to define several commands that are executed inside python virtual environments, so without touching your system libraries, it can get installed new ones or removed just for the boundaries of that test, helping into running:\npep8 (python formating compliance) py27 (python 2.7 environment test) py35 (python 3.5 environment test) The py* tests are just to validate the code can run on both base python versions, and what they do is to run the defined unit testing scripts under each interpreter to validate.\nFor local test, you can run tox and it will go trough the different tests defined and report status\u0026hellip; if everything is ok, it should be possible that your new code review passes also CI.\nJenkins will do the +1 on verified and \u0026lsquo;core\u0026rsquo; reviewers will give +2 and \u0026lsquo;merge\u0026rsquo; the change once validated.

Citellus is a framework populated by community-contributed scripts that automate detecting problems, including configuration issues, conflicts with package versions, and more. History: how did was it started? The tool, started by Robin Černín after a long weekend shift checking one and over again several sosreports for the same data on different hosts.\nIt started with some tests + shell wrapper, and was added a python wrapper by Pablo Iranzo to bring in more powerful features.\nAfter some design discussions with Engineering, a simpler reporting and design of tests was implemented.\nWhat can you do with Citellus? Run against a sosreport or live environment. Solve issues faster thanks to the information it provides. Use the community-provided plugins for detecting actual or potential issues. Code new plugins in your language of choice (bash, python, ruby, etc.) to extend functionality. Contribute them upstream for others to benefit. Use that information as part of proactive insights about the systems. Real life examples? For example, with Citellus you can detect: Failed keystone token purges. missing parameters in expired ceilometer data, which can lead to filling up your hard drive. unsynced NTP. outdated packages that have known critical issues. others! (119 plugins as of this writing some of them with more than one issue detected) Whatever else you can imagine or code 😉 Some numbers on plugin count: bugzilla : 15 [\u0026#39;openstack/swift: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;openstack/keystone/templates: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;openstack/ceph: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;httpd: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;openstack/keystone: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;openstack/ceilometer: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;openstack/nova: 2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;openstack/httpd: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;systemd: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;openstack/tripleo: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;openstack/neutron: 4\u0026#39;] launchpad : 1 [\u0026#39;openstack/keystone: 1\u0026#39;] network : 1 [] openstack : 54 [\u0026#39;nova: 8\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mysql: 6\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rabbitmq: 3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;containers/rabbitmq: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;network: 3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;glance: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;containers/docker: 2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;containers: 4\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;cinder: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;hardware: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;swift: 2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;systemd: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;iptables: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ceph: 4\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;keystone: 3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;system: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;redis: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;neutron: 1\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;crontab: 3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ceilometer: 3\u0026#39;] pacemaker : 7 [] security : 12 [\u0026#39;meltdown: 2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;spectre: 8\u0026#39;] system : 28 [] virtualization : 1 [] The goal Be so damn simple to write new plugins that anyone can do them. Allow to write tests in whatever language of choice (bash, python, perl, etc) as long as they conform to some standards. Allow anyone to submit new plugins. How to run it manually? ![](citellusrun.png\u0026quot; height=\u0026ldquo;20%\u0026rdquo; border=0\u0026gt;\nNote: Change speaker after this\nHighlights Plugins in your language of choice. Allows to dump output to json file to be processed by other tools. Allow to visualize html from json output. Ansible playbook support (live and snapshoot if crafted playbooks) Core implemented as extension to easily expand with new ones. Save / restore default settings HTML Interface Create by using \u0026ndash;output and \u0026ndash;web, open the generated citellus.html over http. ![](www.png\u0026quot; height=\u0026ldquo;40%\u0026rdquo; border=0\u0026gt; Why upstream? This is an open source project. All the scripts should be committed upstream and shared (and we are willing to foster this) Project on GitHub: https://github.com/citellusorg/citellus/ We want contributions to happen from anyone. We follow an approach similar to other OpenSource projects: we do use Gerrit for reviewing the code and UT\u0026rsquo;s for validating basic functionality. How do I contribute? At the moment, there’s a strong presence on OpenStack plugins as it is where we solve our issues on everyday basis, but allows anything, as long as there are tests written for it.\nFor example, it will be easy to report on systems registered against RHN instead of CDN or systems with a specific version of pacemaker known to have lot of issues or check amount of free memory or memory usage from a process.\nRead contributing doc at: https://github.com/citellusorg/citellus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.\nCitellus vs other tools XSOS: Provides information on ram usage, etc, no analysis, more like a ‘fancy’ sosreport viewer.\nTripleO-validations: only runs live from the environment, for customer support most of times we cannot afford to do that.\nWhy not sosreports? It’s not Citellus or ‘sosreports’, SOS collects data from the system, Citellus, runs tests/plugins against the data collected. Sosreport is installed in RHEL base channels, this makes it well spread, but also, slower to get changes. Frequently, data about errors or errors to be, is already in sosreports. Citellus is based on known issues and easy to extend with new ones, requires faster devel cycle, targeting more a DEVOPS or support teams as target audience. Note: Change speaker after this\nHow does it work under the hood? Philosophy is very simple:\nCitellus is just a simple wrapper. Allows to specify on sosreport and test folders Finds tests available in test folders Executes each test against sosreport and reports return status Framework written in python which features option parsing, parallel execution of tests, filtering, etc. What about the plugins? Tests are even simpler:\nWritten in whatever language of choice as long as they can be executed from shell. Output messages to ‘stderr’ (\u0026gt;\u0026amp;2) When using strings like echo $”string” bash’s built-in i18n is used so you can translate in your language. Return $RC_OKAY for success / $RC_FAILED for error / $RC_SKIPPED for skipped tests / Other for unexpected error What about the plugins? (continuation) Will inherit some env vars like root folder for sosreport (empty for live) (CITELLUS_ROOT) or if running live (CITELLUS_LIVE) that provide required details. No user input should be required. Live tests can for example query DB and ones in sosreport check values on logs Some execution and script examples? Check disk usage:\n#!/bin/bash # Load common functions [ -f \u0026#34;${CITELLUS_BASE}/common-functions.sh\u0026#34; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; . \u0026#34;${CITELLUS_BASE}/common-functions.sh\u0026#34; # description: error if disk usage is greater than $CITELLUS_DISK_MAX_PERCENT : ${CITELLUS_DISK_MAX_PERCENT=75} if [[ $CITELLUS_LIVE = 0 ]]; then is_required_file \u0026#34;${CITELLUS_ROOT}/df\u0026#34; DISK_USE_CMD=\u0026#34;cat ${CITELLUS_ROOT}/df\u0026#34; else DISK_USE_CMD=\u0026#34;df -P\u0026#34; fi result=$($DISK_USE_CMD |awk -vdisk_max_percent=$CITELLUS_DISK_MAX_PERCENT \u0026#39;/^\\/dev/ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; substr($5, 0, length($5)-1) \u0026gt; disk_max_percent { print $6,$5 }\u0026#39;) if [ -n \u0026#34;$result\u0026#34; ]; then echo \u0026#34;${result}\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 exit $RC_FAILED else exit $RC_OKAY fi Ready for deep dive on tests? There are more tests for OpenStack at the moment as this is the speciality where it started, but it’s open and able to extend to whatever is needed.\nEach test should take care of checking if it should run or not and output return code and stderr. Wrapper just runs all the tests or specific ones (filtering options)\nHow to start a new plugin (example) Write a script in ~/~/.../plugins/core/rhev/hosted-engine.sh chmod +x hosted-engine.sh Requirements: return code must be $RC_OKAY (ok), $RC_FAILED (failed) or $RC_SKIPPED (skipped) Messages to be printed on stderr are displayed on failed or ‘skipped’ if verbose enabled Running against ‘sosreport’, CITELLUS_ROOT contains path to sosreport folder provided. CITELLUS_LIVE contains 0 or 1 if running against live or not How to start a new plugin (continuation) if [ “$CITELLUS_LIVE” = “0” ]; then grep -q ovirt-hosted-engine-ha $CITELLUS_ROOT/installed-rpms returncode=$? if [ “x$returncode” == “x0” ]; then exit $RC_OKAY else echo “ovirt-hosted-engine is not installed “ \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 exit $RC_FAILED fi else echo “Not running on Live system” \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 exit $RC_SKIPPED fi How to start a new plugin (with functions) # Load common functions [ -f \u0026#34;${CITELLUS_BASE}/common-functions.sh\u0026#34; ] \u0026amp;\u0026amp; . \u0026#34;${CITELLUS_BASE}/common-functions.sh\u0026#34; if is_rpm ovirt-hosted-engine-ha; then exit $RC_OKAY else echo “ovirt-hosted-engine is not installed “ \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 exit $RC_FAILED fi How to test your plugin? Use tox to run some UT\u0026rsquo;s (utf8, bashate, python 2.7, python 3.5)\nSpecify the plugin to use:\n[piranzo@host citellus]$ ~/citellus/citellus.py sosreport-20170724-175510/crta02 -i hosted-engine.sh _________ .__ __ .__ .__ \\_ ___ \\|__|/ |_ ____ | | | | __ __ ______ / \\ \\/| \\ __\\/ __ \\| | | | | | \\/ ___/ \\ \\___| || | \\ ___/| |_| |_| | /\\___ \\ \\______ /__||__| \\___ \u0026gt;____/____/____//____ \u0026gt; \\/ \\/ \\/ mode: fs snapshot sosreport-20170724-175510/crta02 # ~/~/.../plugins/core/rhev/hosted-engine.sh: failed “ovirt-hosted-engine is not installed “ What is Magui Introduction Citellus works on individual sosreports against a set of tests (all by default), but some problems require checks across several systems. For example, Galera requires to check seqno across all controllers running database.\nWhat does M.a.g.u.i. Does? It runs citellus against each sosreport, gathers and groups the data per plugin. Runs its own plugins against the data received to highlight issues that depend on several systems Allows to grab remote host data via ansible host lists How does it looks like? It’s delivered in citellus repo and can be executed by specifying sosreports:\n[piranzo@collab-shell]$ ~/citellus/magui.py * -i seqno _ _( )_ Magui: (_(ø)_) /(_) Multiple Analisis Generic Unifier and Interpreter \\| |/ {\u0026#39;~/~/.../plugins/core/openstack/mysql/seqno.sh\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;controller0\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;err\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;2b65adb0-787e-11e7-81a8-26480628c14c:285019879\\n\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;out\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rc\u0026#39;: 10}, \u0026#39;controller1\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;err\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;2b65adb0-787e-11e7-81a8-26480628c14c:285019879\\n\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;out\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rc\u0026#39;: 10}, \u0026#39;controller2\u0026#39;: {\u0026#39;err\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;2b65adb0-787e-11e7-81a8-26480628c14c:285019878\\n\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;out\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rc\u0026#39;: 10}}} On this example, UUID and SEQNO is shown for each controller and we can see that controller 2 has different SEQNO to the other two nodes. Next steps with Magui Plugins as of this writing: Aggregate data from citellus sorted by plugin for quick comparison Show \u0026lsquo;metadata\u0026rsquo; extension separated to quickly compare across values pipeline-yaml different across sosreports seqno and highest seqno in Galera release check across hosts Action Items Add more plugins! Evangelize about the tool so we can work together in solving our common issues on the same framework. Get moving fast enough that the tool has continuity, other tools just died by having a ‘solo’ developer working on spare time Start implementing more tests in Magui that provide real intelligence (for example we do report and check on seqno or pipeline-yaml but lot of other issues can benefit from this).

We\u0026rsquo;ve created lot of functions to check different things: installed rpm rpm over specific version compare dates over X days regexp in file etc.. Functions do allow to do quicker plugin development. save/restore options so they can be loaded automatically for each execution Think of enabled filters, excluded, etc metadata added for plugins and returned as dictionary plugin has a unique ID for all installations based on plugin relative path and plugin name We do use that ID in magui to select the plugin data we\u0026rsquo;ll be acting on plugin priority! Plugins are assigned a number between 0 and 1000 that represents how likely it\u0026rsquo;s going to affect your environment, and you can filter also on it with --prio extended via \u0026rsquo;extensions\u0026rsquo; to provide support for other plugins moved prior plugins to be core extension ansible playbook support via ansible-playbook command metadata plugins that just generate metadata (hostname, date for sosreport, etc) Web Interface!! David Valee Delisle did a great job on preparing an html that loads citellus.json and shows it graphically. Thanks to his work, we did extended some other features like priority, categories, etc that are calculated via citellus and consumed via citellus-www. Interface can also load magui.json (with ?json=magui.json) and show it\u0026rsquo;s output. We did extend citellus to take --web to automatically create the json named citellus.json on the folder specified with -o and copy the citellus.html file there. So if you provide sosreports over http, you can point to citellus.html to see graphical status! (check latest image at citellus website as www.png ) Increased plugin count! Now we do have more than 119 across different categories A new plugin in python reboot.py that checks for unexpected reboots Spectre/Meltdown security checks! Magui If there\u0026rsquo;s an existing citellus.json magui does load it to speed it up process across multiple sosreports. Magui can also use ansible-playbook to copy citellus program to remote host and run there the command, and bring back the generated citellus.json so you can quickly run citellus across several hosts without having to manually perform operations or generate sosreports. Moved prior data to two plugins: citellus-outputs Citellus plugins output arranged by plugin and sosreport citellus-metadata Outputs metadata gathered by metadata plugins in citellus arranged by plugin and sosreport First plugins that compare data received from citellus on global level Plugins are written in python and use each plugin id to just work on the data they know how to process pipeline-yaml Checks if pipeline.yaml and warns if is different across hosts seqno Checks latest galera seqno on hosts release Reports RHEL release across hosts and warns if is different across hosts Enable quiet mode on the data received from citellus as well as local plugins, so only outputs with ERROR or different output on sosreports is shown, even on magui plugins. Wrap up! As you can see we\u0026rsquo;ve been busy trying to improve plugins, Citellus framework and Magui as well.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve been also busy demonstrating to others it\u0026rsquo;s value and raising lot of new issues and closing them with our commits (294 requests closed so far).\nSo, come and tell us what else are you missing or how can we improve it to suit your needs (or code them yourself and submit a review!)

After some research I came to bashate, and as it was written in python was very easy to integrate:\nUpdate test-requirements.txt to request bashate for \u0026rsquo;tests'\nEditing tox.ini to add a new section\n[testenv:bashate] commands = bash -c \u0026#39;find citellus -name \u0026#34;*.sh\u0026#34; -type f -print0 | xargs -0 bashate -i E006\u0026#39; This change makes that execution of tox also pulls the output of bashate so all the integration already done for CI, was automatically update to do bash formatting too :-)\nBash i18n Another topic that was interesting is the ability to easily write code in one language and via poedit or equivalent editors, be able to localize it.\nIn python is more or less easy as we did for citellus code, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of any way of doing that for bash scripts (such as the plugins we do use for citellus).\nDoing a simple man bash gives some hints somewhat hidden:\n--dump-po-strings Equivalent to -D, but the output is in the GNU gettext po (portable object) file format. So, bash has a way to dump po strings (to be edited with poedit or your editor of choice), so only a bit more search was required to find how to really do it.\nApparently is a lot easier than I expected, as long as we take some considerations:\nLANG shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be C as it disables i18n Environment variable TEXTDOMAIN should indicate the filename containing the translated strings. Environment variable TEXTDOMAINDIR should contain the path to the root of the folder containing the translations, for example: TEXTDOMAIN=citellus/locale And language file for en as: citellus/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/$TEXTDOMAIN.mo Now, the \u0026ldquo;trickier\u0026rdquo; part was to prepare scripts\u0026hellip;\n# Legacy way echo \u0026#34;String\u0026#34; # i18n way echo $\u0026#34;String\u0026#34; # Difficult... isn\u0026#39;t it? This change makes \u0026lsquo;bash\u0026rsquo; to lock for the string inside $TEXTDOMAINDIR/locale/$LANG/LC_MESSAGES/$TEXTDOMAIN.mo and do on the fly replacement of the strings for the translated ones (or fallback to the one echoed).\nIn citellus we did implement it by exporting the extra variables defined above, so scripts, as well as framework is ready for translation!.\nJust in case, some remarks:\nI found some complains when same script outputs the same string in several places, what I did, is to create a VAR and echo that var.\nAs we\u0026rsquo;ve strings in citellus.py, magui.py, etc and the bash files, I did update a script to extract the required strings:\n# Extract python strings python setup.py extract_messages -F babel.cfg -k _L # Extract bash strings find citellus -name \u0026#34;*.sh\u0026#34; -exec bash --dump-po-strings \u0026#34;{}\u0026#34; \\; \u0026gt; citellus/locale/citellus-plugins.pot # Merge bash and python strings msgcat -F citellus/locale/citellus.pot citellus/locale/citellus-plugins.pot \u0026gt; citellus/locale/citellus-new.pot # Move file to destination cat citellus/locale/citellus-new.pot \u0026gt; citellus/locale/citellus.pot In this way, we\u0026rsquo;re ready to use on editor to translate all the strings for the whole citellus + plugins.\nEnjoy!

The wrapper does check the plugins available (can be anything executable from Linux, so bash, Python, etc are there to be used) Then it setups some environment variables like the path to find the data and proceeds to execute the plugins against, recording the output of them. The plugins, on their side, determine if: Plugin should be run or skipped if it\u0026rsquo;s a live system, a sosreport Plugin should run because of required file or package missing Provide return code of: $RC_OKAY for success $RC_FAILED for failure $RC_SKIPPED for skip anything else (Undetermined error) Provide stderr with relevant messages: Reason to be skipped Reason for failure etc The wrapper then sorts the output, and prints it based on settings (grouping skipped and ok by default) and detailing failures. You can check the provided plugins on the Github repository (and hopefully also collaborate sending yours).\nOur target is to keep plugins easy to write, so we can extend the plugin set as much as possible, highlighting were focus should be put at first and once typical issues are ruled out, check on the deeper analysis.\nEven if we\u0026rsquo;ve started with OpenStack plugins (that\u0026rsquo;s what we do for a living), the software is open to check against whatever is there, and we\u0026rsquo;ve reached to other colleagues in different speciality areas to provide more feedback or contributions to make it even more useful.\nAs Citellus works with sosreports it is easy to have it installed locally and test new tests.\nWriting a new test Leading by the example is probably easier, so let\u0026rsquo;s illustrate how to create a basic plugin for checking if a system is a RHV hosted engine:\n#!/bin/bash if [ \u0026#34;$CITELLUS_LIVE\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;0\u0026#34; ]; ## Checks if we\u0026#39;re running live or not then grep -q ovirt-hosted-engine-ha $CITELLUS_ROOT/installed-rpms ## checks package returncode=$? #stores return code if [ \u0026#34;x$returncode\u0026#34; == \u0026#34;x0\u0026#34; ]; then exit $RC_OKAY else echo \u0026#34;ovirt-hosted-engine is not installed \u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 #Outputs info exit $RC_FAILED e #returns code to wrapper fi else echo \u0026#34;Not running on Live system\u0026#34; \u0026gt;\u0026amp;2 exit $RC_SKIPPED fi Above example is a bit hacky, as we count on wrapper not to output information if return code is $RC_OKAY, so it should have another conditional to write output or not.\nHow to debug? Easiest way to do trial-error would be to create a new folder for your plugins to test and use something like this:\n[user@host mytests]$ ~/citellus/citellus.py /cases/01884438/sosreport-20170724-175510/ycrta02.rd1.rf1 ~/mytests/ [-d debug] DEBUG:__main__:Additional parameters: [\u0026#39;/cases/sosreport-20170724-175510/hostname\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;/home/remote/piranzo/mytests/\u0026#39;] DEBUG:__main__:Found plugins: [\u0026#39;/home/remote/piranzo/mytests/ovirt-engine.sh\u0026#39;] _________ .__ __ .__ .__ \\_ ___ \\|__|/ |_ ____ | | | | __ __ ______ / \\ \\/| \\ __\\/ __ \\| | | | | | \\/ ___/ \\ \\___| || | \\ ___/| |_| |_| | /\\___ \\ \\______ /__||__| \\___ \u0026gt;____/____/____//____ \u0026gt; \\/ \\/ \\/ found #1 tests at /home/remote/piranzo/mytests/ mode: fs snapshot /cases/sosreport-20170724-175510/hostname DEBUG:__main__:Running plugin: /home/remote/piranzo/mytests/ovirt-engine.sh # /home/remote/piranzo/mytests/ovirt-engine.sh: failed \u0026#34;ovirt-hosted-engine is not installed \u0026#34; DEBUG:__main__:Plugin: /home/remote/piranzo/mytests/ovirt-engine.sh, output: {\u0026#39;text\u0026#39;: u\u0026#39;\\x1b[31mfailed\\x1b[0m\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;rc\u0026#39;: 1, \u0026#39;err\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;\\xe2\\x80\\x9covirt-hosted-engine is not installed \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\n\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;out\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;\u0026#39;} That debug information comes from the python wrapper, if you need more detail inside your test, you can try set -x to have bash showing more information about progress.\nKeep always in mind that all functionality is based on return codes and the stderr message to keep it simple.\nEnjoy!

From this point, we\u0026rsquo;ve a base virtualenv installed, but as we would like to install more packages inside we\u0026rsquo;ll first need to \u0026rsquo;enter\u0026rsquo; into it:\n. .venv/bin/activate And from there, we can list the available/installed packages:\n[iranzo@iranzo ~]$ pip list DEPRECATION: The default format will switch to columns in the future. You can use --format=(legacy|columns) (or define a format=(legacy|columns) in your pip.conf under the [list] section) to disable this warning. appdirs (1.4.0) packaging (16.8) pip (9.0.1) pyparsing (2.1.10) setuptools (34.2.0) six (1.10.0) wheel (0.30.0a0) Now, all packages we install using pip will get installed to this folder, leaving system libraries intact.\nOnce we finished, to return back to system\u0026rsquo;s environment, we\u0026rsquo;ll execute deactivate.\npipsi In order to simplify the management we can make use of pipsi which not only allows to install Python packages as we\u0026rsquo;ll normally do with pip, but also, takes care of doing proper symlinks so the installed packages are available directly for execution.\nIf our distribution provides it, we can install pipsi on our system:\ndnf -y install pipsi But if not, we can use this workaround (for example, on RHEL7)\n# Use pip to install pipsi on the system (should be minor change not affecting other software installed) pip install pipsi From this point, we can use pipsi to take care of installation and maintenance (can do upgrades, removal, etc) of our python packages.\nFor example, we can install ansible by executing:\npipsi install ansible This might fail, as ansible, does some compiling and for doing so, it might require some development libraries on your system, have care of that to satisfy requirements for the packages.\nPrepare for ansible utilization At this point we\u0026rsquo;ve the ansible binary available for execution as pipsi did take care of setting up the required symlinks, etc\nAnsible uses an inventory file (can be provided on command line) so it can connect to the hosts listed there and apply playbooks which define the different actions to perform.\nThis file, for example, can consist of just a simple list of hosts to connect to like:\n192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 myhostname.net And for starting we create a simple playbook, for example a hardware asset inventory:\n--- - hosts: all user: root tasks: - name: Display inventory of host debug: msg: \u0026#34;{{ inventory_hostname }} | {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }} | | | {{ ansible_memtotal_mb }} | | | {{ ansible_bios_date }}\u0026#34; This will act on all hosts, as user root and will run a task which prints a debug message crafted based on the contents of some of the facts that ansible gathers on the execution host.\nTo run it is quite easy:\n[iranzo@iranzo labs]$ ansible-playbook -i myhost.net, inventory.yaml PLAY [all] ********************************************************************* TASK [setup] ******************************************************************* ok: [myhost.net] TASK [Display inventory of host] *********************************************** ok: [myhost.net] =\u0026gt; { \u0026#34;msg\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myhost.net | 192.168.1.1 | | | 14032 | | | 01/01/2011\u0026#34; } PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************* myhost.net : ok=2 changed=0 unreachable=0 failed=0 This has connected to the target host, and returned a message with hostname, ip address, some empty fields, total memory and bios date.\nThis is a quite simple script, but for example, we can use ansible to deploy ansible binary on our target host using other modules available, in this case, for simplicity, we\u0026rsquo;ll not be using pipsi for ansible installation.\n--- - hosts: all user: root tasks: - name: Install git yum: name: - \u0026#34;git\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;python-virtualenv\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;openssl-devel\u0026#34; state: latest - name: Install virtualenv pip: virtualenv: \u0026#34;/root/infrared/.venv\u0026#34; name: pipsi - name: Upgrade virtualenv pip pip: virtualenv: \u0026#34;/root/infrared/.venv\u0026#34; name: pip extra_args: --upgrade - name: Upgrade virtualenv setuptools pip: virtualenv: \u0026#34;/root/infrared/.venv\u0026#34; name: setuptools extra_args: --upgrade - name: Install Ansible pip: virtualenv: \u0026#34;/root/infrared/.venv\u0026#34; name: ansible At this point, the system should have ansible available from within the virtualenv we\u0026rsquo;ve created and should be available when executing:\n# Activate python virtualenv . .venv/bin/activate # execute ansible ansible-playbook -i hosts ansible.yaml Enjoy!

and to provide further automation, I\u0026rsquo;ve also relied on tox also inspired n what OpenStack does.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with tox: once installed, a new configuration file is created for it, defining the different environments and configuration in a similar way to:\n[tox] minversion = 2.0 envlist = py27,pep8 skipsdist = True [testenv] passenv = CI TRAVIS TRAVIS_* deps = -r{toxinidir}/requirements.txt -r{toxinidir}/test-requirements.txt commands = /usr/bin/find . -type f -name \u0026#34;*.pyc\u0026#34;

is created and after it an assert is used, for example assertEqual validates that the function call returns the value provided as secondary argument, failing otherwise.\nFrom that point, the tests are performed again in alphabetically order, so be careful in the naming of each tests or define a sequence number to use a top-to-bottom approach that will be probably easier to understand.\nFor example, for karma changes we\u0026rsquo;ve:\n#!/usr/bin/env python # encoding: utf-8 from unittest import TestCase from stampy.stampy import getkarma, updatekarma, putkarma class TestStampy(TestCase): def test_putkarma(self): putkarma(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;, 0) self.assertEqual(getkarma(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;), 0) def test_getkarma(self): self.assertEqual(getkarma(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;), 0) def test_updatekarmaplus(self): updatekarma(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;, 2) self.assertEqual(getkarma(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;), 2) def test_updatekarmarem(self): updatekarma(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;, -1) self.assertEqual(getkarma(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;), 1) Which starts by putting a known karma on a word, validating, verifying the query, update the value by a positive number and later, decrease it with a negative one.\nFor the aliases, we use a similar approach, as we also play with the karma changes when an alias is defined:\n#!/usr/bin/env python # encoding: utf-8 from unittest import TestCase from stampy.stampy import getkarma, putkarma, createalias, getalias, deletealias class TestStampy(TestCase): def test_createalias(self): createalias(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;creilla\u0026#34;) self.assertEqual(getalias(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;creilla\u0026#34;) def test_getalias(self): self.assertEqual(getalias(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;creilla\u0026#34;) def test_increasealiaskarma(self): updatekarma(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;, 1) self.assertEqual(getkarma(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;), 1) # Alias doesn\u0026#39;t get increased as the \u0026#39;aliases\u0026#39; modifications are in # process, not in the individual functions self.assertEqual(getkarma(\u0026#34;creilla\u0026#34;), 0) def test_removealias(self): deletealias(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;) self.assertEqual(getkarma(\u0026#34;creilla\u0026#34;), 0) def test_removekarma(self): putkarma(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;, 0) self.assertEqual(getkarma(\u0026#34;patata\u0026#34;), 0) Where an alias is created, verified, karma in creased on the word with an alias, and then the aliased value.\nAs noted in the above example, the individual function for the karma doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into consideration the aliases so this must be handled by processing a message set via process(messages) which has been also modified as well as other functions to allow the implementation of individual tests for them.\nThis will for sure end up with some more code rewriting so the functions can be fully tested individually and as a whole, to ensure that the bot behaves as intended\u0026hellip; and many more tests to come to the code.\nAs an end, an example of the execution of tox and the results raised:\ntox py27 installed: coverage==4.2,nose==1.3.7,prettytable==0.7.2 py27 runtests: PYTHONHASHSEED=\u0026#39;604985980\u0026#39;

Don\u0026rsquo;t bypass the git configuration steps at above guide as we\u0026rsquo;ll need them for next steps. Submitting a change is quite easy:\n# Select the project, \u0026#39;neutron-lbaas\u0026#39; for me each=\u0026#39;neutron-lbaas\u0026#39; git clone git@github.com:openstack/$each.git cd $each # This setups git-review, getting required hooks, etc git-review -s # create a new branch so we can keep our changes separate git branch new-branch # Edit files with changes git add $files git commit -m \u0026#34;Descriptive message\u0026#34; # send to upstream for review: git-review git-review will output an url you can use to preview your change, and the hooks will automatically add a \u0026lsquo;Change-ID\u0026rsquo; so subsequent changes are linked to it.\nNOTE: full reference is available at the Developer\u0026rsquo;s Guide\nThe biggest issue started here:\nIn order to not require a new function to validate integers, I\u0026rsquo;ve used the one for non-negative which already does this tests, but one of the reviewers suggested to write a function Functions were imported from neutron-lib so I submitted a second change to neutron-lib project As the change in neutron-lib couldn\u0026rsquo;t be marked as dependent as neutron-lbaas uses the build the version already published, I had to define another interim version of the function so that neutron-lbaas can use it in the meantime and raise another bug, to later remove this interim function once than neutron-lib includes the validate_integer function As part of the comments on neutron-lib review, it was found that it would be nice to validate values, so after some discussion, I moved to use the internal validate_values. Of course, validate_values is just doing data in valid_values, so it fails if data or valid_values are not comparable and doesn\u0026rsquo;t do conversion of depending on the values itselves, so this spin-off another review for improving the ´validate_values´ function. At the moment, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to close the one to neutron-lib to use the function already defined, and have it merged, and then continue with the other steps, like removing the interim function in neutron-lbaas and work on enhancing validate_values and close all the dependant LaunchPad bugs I\u0026rsquo;ve created for tracking.\nMy experience so far, is that sometimes it might be a bit difficult, as git-review is a collaborative environment so different opinions are being shared with different approaches and some of them are \u0026rsquo;easier\u0026rsquo; and some others \u0026lsquo;pickier\u0026rsquo; like having an \u0026rsquo;extra space\u0026rsquo;, etc.\nOf course, all the code is checked by some automation engines when submitted, which validates that the code still builds, no formatting errors, etc but many of them can be executed locally by using tox, which allows to perform part of the tests like:\ntox -e pep8 tox -e py27 tox -e coverage To respectively, validate pep8 formatting (line length, spaces around operators, docstrings formatting, etc) and to run another set of tests like the ones you define.\nAfter each set of changes performed to apply the feedback received, ensure to:\n# Add the modified files to a commit git add $files_modified # Create the commit with the changes git commit -m \u0026#34;whatever\u0026#34; # This will show you the last two commits, so you can leave the first one and # on the beginning of the second one, # replace \u0026#39;pick\u0026#39; for \u0026#39;f\u0026#39; so the changes are merged with first one without # keeping the commit message git rebase -i HEAD~2 # Fix the commit message if needed (like fixing formatting, # set dependant commits, or bugs it closes, etc) git commit --amend # Submit changes again for review git-review Also, keep in mind that apart from submitting the code change is important to submit automated validation tests, which can be executed with tox -e py27 to view that the functions return the values we expect even if the input data is out of what it should be, or like coverage, to validate that the code is covered (check on tox.ini what is defined).\nAnd last but not least, expect to have lot of comments on more serious changes like changes to stable libs, as lot of reviewers will come to ensure that everything looks good and might even discuss it on the regular meetings to ensure, that a change is a good fit for the product in the proposed approach.

On normal system with libvirt, we can just edit the XML for the VM definition and define the CPU like this:\n\u0026lt;cpu mode=\u0026#39;custom\u0026#39; match=\u0026#39;exact\u0026#39;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;model fallback=\u0026#39;allow\u0026#39;\u0026gt;Opteron_G3\u0026lt;/model\u0026gt; \u0026lt;feature policy=\u0026#39;require\u0026#39; name=\u0026#39;svm\u0026#39;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/cpu\u0026gt; For RHEV, however, we don\u0026rsquo;t have an XML we can edit, as it is created dynamically with the contents of the database for the VM (disks, NICS, name, etc), but we\u0026rsquo;ve the VDSM-Hooks mechanism for doing this.\nHooks in vdsm are a powerful and dangerous tool, as they can modify in-flight the XML used to create the VM, and allow lot of features to be implemented.\nIn the past, for example, those hooks could be used to provide DirectLUN support to RHEV, or fixed BIOS Serial Number for VM\u0026rsquo;s where the product was still lacking the official feature, and in this case, we\u0026rsquo;ll use them to provide the CPU flags we need.\nAs you can imagine, this is something that has lot of interested people behind, and we can find upstream a repository with VDSM-Hooks.\nIn this case, the one that we\u0026rsquo;re needing is \u0026rsquo;nestedvt\u0026rsquo;, so we can proceed to install it on our hosts like:\nwget http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/ovirt/pub/ovirt-3.4/rpm/el7/noarch/vdsm-hook-nestedvt-4.14.17-0.el7.noarch.rpm rpm -Uvh vdsm-hook-nestedvt-4.14.17-0.el7.noarch.rpm You\u0026rsquo;ll need to put a host in maintenance and activate for VDSM to refresh the hooks installed and start new VM so we have the hook injecting the XML.\nAfter it boots, egrep 'svm|vmx' /proc/pcuinfo should show the flags there.\nBut wait\u0026hellip;\nRHEV also includes a security feature that makes it impossible for a VM to spy on the communications meant to other VM\u0026rsquo;s that makes it impossible to simulate other MAC\u0026rsquo;s within it, and this is performed via libvirt filters on the interfaces.\nTo come to our rescue, another hook comes to play in, this time macspoof which allows to disable this security measure for a VM so it can execute virtualization within.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s repeat the procedure and install the hook on all of our hypervisors:\nwget http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/ovirt/pub/ovirt-3.4/rpm/el7/noarch/vdsm-hook-macspoof-4.14.17-0.el7.noarch.rpm rpm -Uvh vdsm-hook-macspoof-4.14.17-0.el7.noarch.rpm This will enable the hook in the system, but we also need to make the RHEV-M Engine aware of it, so we need to define a new Custom Property for VM\u0026rsquo;s:\nengine-config -s \u0026#34;UserDefinedVMProperties=macspoof=(true|false)\u0026#34; This will ask us for the compatibility version (we\u0026rsquo;ll choose 3.5) and enable a new true/false property for VM\u0026rsquo;s that require this security measure lifted. We\u0026rsquo;re doing of course this approach instead of disabling it for everyone to limit it\u0026rsquo;s use to just the VM\u0026rsquo;s needing it, not losing all the benefits on security provided.\nAs a side note, macspoof plugin is available in official repositories for RHEL7 hypervisor, so you can use this instead of oVirt\u0026rsquo;s repository one.\nNow when we create a new VM, for example to use with OpenStack, we can go to custom properties for this vm, select macspoof and set a value of \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; and once the VM is started will be able to see the processor extensions for virtualization and at the same time, the VM\u0026rsquo;s created within, will be able to communicate with the outside world.\nEnjoy!

This is something important to note, the packets are only intercepting when coming from OUTSIDE the host so we\u0026rsquo;ll use a second computer to access it.\nYou can use a browser pointing to target system\u0026rsquo;s IP at port 16992, for example: http://target:16992\nFrom that web interface and once logging with admin and the password set Qwer123$ we can continue doing some configuration, like the power states to control (for example, this laptop could be remotely powered when it was with the charger connected even if laptop was powered off).\nNow, for doing the \u0026lsquo;command-line\u0026rsquo; part, we will need to install one package on our system and rum some scripts.\n# First we\u0026#39;ll install amtterm wsmancli dnf -y install amtterm wsmancli # This will provide the two commands we\u0026#39;ll later use, wsman for configuration and amttool for power control # We need to define the host to use and password as well as the password we\u0026#39;ll use for console redirection (via VNC) AMT_PASSWORD=\u0026#39;Qwer123$\u0026#39; AMT_HOST=target VNC_PASSWORD=\u0026#39;Qwer123$\u0026#39; # we can define those vars (specially AMT_PASSWORD) in our .profile or .bash_profile in order to avoid typing them everytime # set the vnc password (must be 8 characters MAX) wsman put http://intel.com/wbem/wscim/1/ips-schema/1/IPS_KVMRedirectionSettingData -h ${AMT_HOST} -P 16992 -u admin -p ${AMT_PASSWORD} -k RFBPassword=${VNC_PASSWORD} # enable KVM redirection to port 5900 (this will also intercept 5900 port for console redirection, so make it sure you\u0026#39;ll not need it later) wsman put http://intel.com/wbem/wscim/1/ips-schema/1/IPS_KVMRedirectionSettingData -h ${AMT_HOST} -P 16992 -u admin -p ${AMT_PASSWORD} -k Is5900PortEnabled=true # disable opt-in policy (do not ask user for console access) wsman put http://intel.com/wbem/wscim/1/ips-schema/1/IPS_KVMRedirectionSettingData -h ${AMT_HOST} -P 16992 -u admin -p ${AMT_PASSWORD} -k OptInPolicy=false # disable session timeout (do not timeout sessions) wsman put http://intel.com/wbem/wscim/1/ips-schema/1/IPS_KVMRedirectionSettingData -h ${AMT_HOST} -P 16992 -u admin -p ${AMT_PASSWORD} -k SessionTimeout=0 # enable KVM (enable keyboard/video/monitor redirection) wsman invoke -a RequestStateChange http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wscim/1/cim-schema/2/CIM_KVMRedirectionSAP -h ${AMT_HOST} -P 16992 -u admin -p ${AMT_PASSWORD} -k RequestedState=2 # OPTIONAL: view settings (validate all the settings) wsman get http://intel.com/wbem/wscim/1/ips-schema/1/IPS_KVMRedirectionSettingData -h ${AMT_HOST} -P 16992 -u admin -p ${AMT_PASSWORD} After this step, we should be able to use vinagre target to access the KVM redirection and remotely control our system.\nFor example, to control power of host you can use:\n# Check host status: amttool $AMT_HOST info # Power up a powered-off host: amttool $AMT_HOST powerup # Power down a powered-on host: amttool $AMT_HOST powerdown Check man amttool for other commands like reset, powercycle.\nIMPORTANT: note that some power state changes can only be performed based on previous status, you can check with info the available ones and current status of system.\nAs a bonus, there\u0026rsquo;s a RFE1 for requesting this tool to be incorporated as power fencing mechanism in fence-agents once \u0026lsquo;amtterm\u0026rsquo; is included in RHEL, in the meantime it\u0026rsquo;s already available in Fedora, and when it comes to RHEL, hopefully could also be used as fence agent for Clusters and RHEV.\nEnjoy!

Can be performed on any system, disk combination, etc Cons The use of dedicated hardware RAID cards allows to offload the CPU intensive tasks for raid calculation, etc to the dedicated processor, freeing internal CPU for system/user usage. Dedicated cards may have fancier features that require no support from the operating system as are all implemented by the card itself and presented to the OS as a standard drive. Performing the setup As I was installing on a HP Microserver G8 recently, I had to first disable the advanced mode for the included controller, so it behaved like a standard SATA one, once done, I was able to boot from my OS image (in this case EL7 ISO).\nOnce the ISO is booted in rescue mode, I could switch to the second console with ALT-F2 so I could start executing commands on the shell.\nFirst step is to setup partitioning, in this case I did two partitions, first one for holding /boot and the second one for setting up the LVM physical volume where the other Logical Volumes will be defined later.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve elected this setup over others because mdadm allows transparent support for booting (grub supports booting form it) and easy to manage setup.\nFor partitions, remember to allocate at least 500mb for /boot and as much as needed for your SO, for example, if only base OS is expected to have RAID protection, having a 20Gb partition will be enough, leaving the remaining disk to be used for a RAID0 device for allocating non-critical files.\nFor both partitions, set type with fdisk to fd: Linux RAID autodetect, and setup the two drives we\u0026rsquo;ll use for initial setup using the same values, for example:\nfdisk /dev/sda n # for new partition p # for primary \u0026lt;ENTER\u0026gt; # for first sector +500M # for size t # for type fd # for Linux RAID autodetect n # new partition p # primary \u0026lt;ENTER\u0026gt; +20G #for size t #for type 2 # for select 2nd partition fd # for Linux RAID autodetect # n for new partition p # for primary \u0026lt;ENTER\u0026gt; # for first sector \u0026lt;ENTER\u0026gt; # for remaining disk t # for type 3 # for third partition fd # for Linux RAID Autodetect w # for Writing changes And repeat that for /dev/sdb\nAt this point, we\u0026rsquo;ll have both sda and sdb with the same partitions defined: sd{a,b}1 with 500Mb for /boot and sd{a,b}2 with 20Gb for LVM and the remaining disk for RAID0 LVM.\nNow, it\u0026rsquo;s time to create the raid device on top, for simplicity, I tend to use md0 for /boot, so let\u0026rsquo;s start with it.\nCreating the raid devices with Multiple Devices mdadm Let\u0026rsquo;s create the raid devices for each system, starting with /boot:\nmdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 mdadm --create /dev/md1 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2 mdadm --create /dev/md2 --level=0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda3 /dev/sdb3 Now, check the status of the raid device creation by issuing:\ncat /proc/mdstat Personalities : [raid1] [raid6] [raid5] [raid4] md0 : active raid1 sda1[0] sdb1[1] 534760 blocks level 1, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [2/2] [UU] [==\u0026gt;..................] recovery = 12.6% (37043392/292945152) finish=127.5min speed=33440K/sec md1 : active raid1 sda2[0] sdb2[1] 20534760 blocks level 1, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [2/2] [UU] [=====\u0026gt;...............] recovery = 25.9% (37043392/692945152) finish=627.5min speed=13440K/sec ... When it finishes, all the devices will appear as synced, and we can start the installation of the operating system.\nWhat I did, after this point, is to reboot the install media, so I could use anaconda installer to select manually the filesystems, creating /boot on /dev/md0, then the Physical Volume on /dev/md1 for the operating system.\nSelect the manual partitioning during the installation to define above devices as their intended usage, and once it has been installed, create the additional Physical volume on /dev/md2 and define the intended mount points, etc.\nEnjoy!

(about 7 minutes)\nThen the fire must be lowered for 5 minutes more, taking care on the amount of broth that, if it becomes scarce will make us lower the fire even more. Right in this moment, a bit of Rosemary can be added to the Paella.\nThe last 3-4 minutes may end with medium to low fire depending on the amount of broth remaining.\nOnce finished, rice must be tasted, fire must be switched off, and the paella must rest for some minutes with a piece of cloth or newspapers above it if the rice was still a bit \u0026lsquo;hard\u0026rsquo;.\nYou can also become creative with the presentation once served:\nEnjoy!

able to grow or shrink the same way.\nNow, we can mount the filesystem:\n#!bash mount /dev/Prueba/Inicial /mnt Resizing an LVM \u0026ldquo;drive\u0026rdquo; EXT3, allows resizing of volumes, so they can grow while being used, but for reducing size we need to stop its usage, and even in that case, it allows the interesting opportunity to create small filesystems, fitted for our initial usage and then keep them growing based on our needs without stop running.\nAs an example, we\u0026rsquo;re going to extend our Inicial filesystem, increasing it in 250Mb, we\u0026rsquo;ll execute:\n#!bash pvscan #(where we will be told about physical volumes and free space) # In case of need, we can extend our volume group with: pvcreate /dev/disconuevo vgextend Prueba /dev/disconuevo # From now on, the vg will have the space ready for being used by lv and we will make it grow doing: lvextend -L +250M /dev/Prueba/Inicial ext2online /dev/mapper/Prueba-Inicial After it finishes, the filesystem at /mnt will have an extra 250Mb available.\nWe can make the filesystem grow to a total size, for example, make it grow until 4Gb, to do so, we will do:\n#!bash lvextend -L 4G /dev/Prueba/Inicial ext2online /dev/mapper/Prueba-Inicial Starting in Fedora Core 6 (FC6), the utility ext2online doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, as it has been integrated in resize2fs, so we will execute instead: resize2fs -p /dev/Prueba-Inicial [final size].\nATTENTION: This is a dangerous step, we can lose data\nIf we want to reduce the size of a logical volume, first, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to know how much space is used by the filesystem and then, umount it:\n#!bash umount /dev/mapper/Prueba-Inicial #Next step would be reduce the filesystem: resize2fs /dev/mapper/Prueba-Inicial [new size] I\u0026rsquo;m recommending reduce the filesystem under the final size we want to achieve, so we have a security margin. This size must ALWAYS be higher that the usage3 of the volume.\nWhen the process has ended, we can reduce the volume running:\nlvextend -L -2G /dev/mapper/Prueba-Inicial\nAnd now we will make the filesystem grow to regain the \u0026ldquo;security margin\u0026rdquo; we left with: resize2fs /dev/mapper/Prueba-Inicial.\nGraphical tool Red Hat or Fedora have a graphical tool system-config-lvm which allows to manage logical volumes in our system in the following way.\nIn the next screenshot we can see the physical volumes no assigned to a volume group, and with the options provided by the tool, we can add to an existing volume group or well, create a new volume group:\nHere we can create a new logical volume inside the volume group, we can specify the volume name, the kind of volume as well as size and filesystem:\nHere we can see the volume group \u0026ldquo;Test\u0026rdquo; and the logical and physical view created (as we see, Test is made of four physical volumes: sdb1,sdb2,sdb3,sdb4)\nWhen we select the free space of the logical volume, the following is shown: number of extents, physical location for each physical volume.\nPhysical Extents\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nMultiple Devices: is a software technology that allows creation of several disk grouping levels: linear, raid0, raid1, raid5.

(National Security Agency) allows applications to be confined by the kernel.\nInside that \u0026ldquo;confined area\u0026rdquo;, much more grained than a standard chroot (system where basic executables are copied to another folder in order to have a small subsystem isolated from real system. The drawback is that a small subsystem could have enough utilities to reveal private information from our internal network),in which we can allow only certain operations, for example: adding information to a file, read from a directory but not writing, even just for one file in a standard directory, etc\u0026hellip;\nPolicies Each policy has different applications, and restrictions to the running system. The most extended ones are:\nTargeted Strict MLS (Multi Level Security http://www.cs.stthomas.edu/faculty/resmith/r/mls/index.html A policy is a set of \u0026ldquo;rules\u0026rdquo; that apply to any object of a system, users, software, files, network, etc. Those rules apply to security contexts, where a \u0026ldquo;context\u0026rdquo; for an object is composed of:\nuser:role:type:level:category\nBased on this information, SELinux allows or denies access to any other object in system, and for doing so, it uses rules that allow process access permissions to objects.\nA strict policy would require a very careful setup of system permissions, security contexts, etc, and there are several projects in order to accomplish it.\nThere are several sites on the Internet which provide a locked-down environment for testing (there\u0026rsquo;s one to play at http://www.coker.com.au/selinux/play.html). Those sites make extensive usage of strict policies as well as numerous restrictions to establish user roles, limits, etc.\nA system running in MLS/Strict would be difficult to use as due to security restrictions required by the policy, no windowing environment (there are some projects to achieve this,but using very simple windowing environments) would be available to avoid copying of information between windows (as this could avoid security levels).\nThe Fedora/Red Hat/CentOS approach Those distributions decided to focus on just some services. Instead of using a system-wide restrictive policy, that would make system unusable, their choice was to \u0026ldquo;target\u0026rdquo; services that are subject to attacks, so, for example, there\u0026rsquo;s a policy for Apache that defines exactly what files can read, what can write, what are log files, what should access from disk, etc.\nThis policy is named \u0026ldquo;targeted\u0026rdquo; and for services defined within, it restricts what they can do, and the rest of the system runs as unconfined, as if there was no SELinux enabled at all.\nThis policy balances the security provided by SELinux for critical services, while keeping system usable. Services without rules continue working as on a system with SELinux disabled.\nLearning by example: Apache Working with SELinux For working with SELinux we have several tools available, most of them, are old friends: ls, ps, id, etc.\nMost of those tools have been expanded to use SELinux and have extra parameters, for example, in our example:\nls -lZ /usr/sbin/httpd\\* rwxr-xr-x root root system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t /usr/sbin/httpd rwxr-xr-x root root system_u:object_r:httpd_exec_t /usr/sbin/httpd.worker The \u0026ldquo;-Z\u0026rdquo; tells ls to show SELinux attributes.\nWhere does system stores them First versions of SELinux, used external files, but in order to get included into upstream Kernel, a more standard approach was required, and finally, it got implemented using system \u0026ldquo;Extended Attributes\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, as a consequence, SELinux requires filesystems with xattr support in order to work.\nIn the listing before, apache is listed as system user, object role and httpd_exec type.\nIf we do a ps auxZ|grep httpd\nroot:system_r:httpd_t apache 2923 0.0 0.4 10424 2076 ? S 00:58 0:00 /usr/sbin/httpd We see that process httpd is being executed as root, system role, and httpd type.\nHey, how could that be possible? executable was httpd_exec, but process is httpd_t\u0026hellip;\nWell, SELinux uses process transitions, in this case, httpd_exec_t, when executed, translates to httpd_t and from now on, would be the type regulating what process can or cannot do on our system.\nHow do we start httpd daemon We use a script at /etc/init.d/httpd which:\nls -lZ /etc/init.d/httpd rwxr-xr-x root root system_u:object_r:initrc_exec_t /etc/init.d/httpd Is yet another type!!!\nSELinux defines another kind of \u0026ldquo;domain transition\u0026rdquo; which allows that process started by \u0026ldquo;root\u0026rdquo; or by init transition to final \u0026ldquo;httpd_t\u0026rdquo;, all those rules need to be defined in a module for SELinux.\nAre we supposed to do everything like this on our own Not really ;-). There are several macros that automate this (for example, from /usr/share/selinux/devel/example.te), we can see:\ndomain_type(myapp_t) domain_entry_file(myapp_t, myapp_exec_t) That automatically setup a domain type myapp_t, and a transition from myapp_exec_t to myapp_t when that executable is loaded for running it on our system.\nHow does apache loads its config files ls -lZd /etc/httpd/ drwxr-xr-x root root system_u:object_r:httpd_config_t /etc/httpd/ As Apache will need to use that directory, we need to put in our custom template that permission, so we will write on our template:\nallow httpd_t httpd_config_t:dir r_dir_perms; allow httpd_t httpd_config_t:file r_file_perms; This will give permission to access \u0026quot;dir\u0026quot;ectories with read-only permissions as well as read-only permission to \u0026ldquo;file\u0026quot;s with that type.\nWhy do this? Well. it\u0026rsquo;s a question about security\u0026hellip; ¿why should Apache write to configuration files? SELinux allows us to confine apache in just the minimum required permissions to work without any chance to harm our system.\nIn a chroot environment, an attacker could get into a minimal system which could give access to our internal network, SELinux will limit this :-)\nHow do we setup correct SELinux rules to allow something blocked Well, our installed system has a graphical SELinux troubleshooter that will pop up when there are any kind of problems with rules.\nThere is an command-line utility named \u0026ldquo;audit2allow\u0026rdquo; that will told us what we need to enable in order to get that problem fixed, for example:\nWhat if we try to run httpd listening on port 27 audit2allow -a #============= httpd_t ============== allow httpd_t reserved_port_t:tcp_socket name_bind; Well, this will be the \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo;, but this is a \u0026ldquo;dirty\u0026rdquo; one, as will allow Apache to hook on any reserved port.\nSELinux provides semanage that allows to define several behaviors, for example, the ports available to use by httpd_t:\nsemanage port -l|grep http http_port_t tcp 80, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443 Well, http_t uses http_port_t that enables Apache to hook on those ports, if we need to make apache to listen on 27, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to execute:\nsemanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 27\nThis will add port 27 using TCP to http_port_t type, and this will make Apache work ;-)\nsemanage also helps into defining clearance levels for users, and map user logins to security levels, so we can have users that get a specific clearance, that even root will not be able to access, so those files would be \u0026ldquo;private\u0026rdquo;.\nsemanage login -l Login Name SELinux User MLS/MCS Range __default__ user_u s0 root root SystemLow-SystemHigh In this case, any user gets mapped to user_u and s0 level, root instead, gets root user and s0.c0 to s0.c255 level\nWe can test with policies and disabling them or not using setenforce. Set enforce allows to switch SELinux enforcing behaviour without rebooting system, so we can freely test our rules without wasting time on reboots.\nWrite a simple policy Well, in order to write a simple policy, we need the selinux-devel package on our system, and then:\ncp /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile /root cd /root Now we will need to edit a template and put something like this:\npolicy_module(hello-world,1.0.0) type myapp_t; type myapp_exec_t; domain_type(myapp_t) domain_entry_file(myapp_t, myapp_exec_t) type myapp_log_t; logging_log_file(myapp_log_t) type myapp_tmp_t; files_tmp_file(myapp_tmp_t) allow myapp_t myapp_log_t:file ra_file_perms; allow myapp_t myapp_tmp_t:file manage_file_perms; files_tmp_filetrans(myapp_t,myapp_tmp_t,file) This was the sample template placed at /usr/share/selinux/devel/example.te, using it together with example.fc:\n/usr/sbin/myapp — gen_context(system_u:object_r:myapp_exec_t,s0) Will provide a complete policy for our app:\nThis defines that /usr/sbin/myapp will have the context system_u:object_r:myapp_exec_t and s0. Depending on the policy we\u0026rsquo;re running, the gen_context will create adequate context for that file.\nIn order to get it loaded, we just need to do make load, and module will be compiled (they use m4 macro language), and then loaded.\nHow do we verify that a module has been loaded With semodule -l all loaded modules will be shown, remember that some policies allow booleans to enable or disable certain aspects of them. We can check all defined booleans for currently loaded modules with getsebool -a and we can set them with setsebool , using \u0026ldquo;-P\u0026rdquo; in order to set that value as default after reboots.\nWe can switch a value using togglesebool value but this will not set it as default for next reboot.\nI hope this can help you as a small introduction to SELinux and it\u0026rsquo;s features :)\nPD: News and updates about SELinux at SELinux News Enjoy!

This feature it is managed using the also improved admin web interface.\nOCS-NG could be setup on different machines hosting each service:\nAn Inventory-receiving machine An Admin web interface A site with information about packages A site with package fragments for deployment or, as I did in my setup, use a Debian Linux machine for doing the four tasks, but I plan to relay the fourth task to other machines, when packages are bigger than expected.\nSetting it up and running I\u0026rsquo;ll assume that you\u0026rsquo;ve running Apache, PHP, and were able to set up OCS using the bundled instructions, so you only have to enable new features for using package deployment.\nFirst of all, we need SSL support in Apache.\nPackage deployment infrastructure, is too much powerful, so it requires SSL access to validate server before trying to download from it, so\u0026hellip; we\u0026rsquo;ll need some SSL certificates for use with our server.\nI like http://www.cacert.org services: they sign your certificates, and provide one certificate aiming to be used with many FOSS projects, because it\u0026rsquo;s free instead of paid certificates like the ones from Thawte or Verisign.\nGetting SSL Certificates First of all, we need to create a private key and a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) which we will send to CACERT for signing (please, note that if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a domain name, will make it impossible to use OCS Package Deployment if your IP is also dynamic, so if that is your case (as was mine too), open an account at No-IP and create an URL-redirect to your machine, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to install an update client, but this will allow you to use certificates) it.\nHaving OpenSSL installed, we will execute (please, double check that questions, specially CN exactly matches ServerName and hostname, for it to work properly after) the following commands:\n#!bash openssl genrsa -out server.key 1024 openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr First one, will create a private key called \u0026ldquo;server.key\u0026rdquo;, second one, will create a CSR which we will paste at https://www.cacert.org/account.php?id=10 to get our server certificate signed.\nFor being able to use http://www.cacert.org services, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to create an account and add a domain to it, this is verified sending an email to an account like webmaster, root or so, clicking on the supplied link, will entitle to work in representation of that domain.\nAfter that, Cacert.org will show you a certificate for your server that you\u0026rsquo;ll have to copy to a file named server.crt.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s then download CACERT\u0026rsquo;s root certificate to cacert.pem\nConfiguring apache for using that certificates Next, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to tell apache, to use this certificate for SSL support, in my case, I configured:\n#!apache /etc/apache2/conf.d/ssl: SSLProtocol all SSLOptions +StdEnvVars SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL SSLCACertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/cacert.pem SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key So, I had to put server.crt, server.key and cacert.pem in /etc/apache2/ssl/\nNext one, was to configure a new site that requires SSL to work:\n#!apache /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/001-default: ServerName yourserver.no-ip.org NameVirtualHost \\*:443 ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/errssl.log # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, # alert, emerg. LogLevel warn CustomLog /var/log/apache2/ssl.log combined ServerSignature On DocumentRoot /var/www SSLEngine on SSLOptions +StdEnvVars SetEnvIf User-Agent \u0026#34;.\\*MSIE.\\*\u0026#34; nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown After that\u0026hellip; we have to reload Apache configuration and try to connect to https://yourserver.no-ip.org to check if everything is ok.\nWell, if this works, we had the first and harder step done ;)\nCreating a package There are three types of packages: RUN, STORE and LAUNCH.\nEach of them has different behavior, one runs a command, the other downloads a file and stores it on a folder, and the other does a combined thing: downloads a file, unzips it, and then runs a command.\nFor Package creating, we must have write access to Apache\u0026rsquo;s DocumentRoot/download folder, and after creation, copy contents of \u0026ldquo;/download\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;/\u0026rdquo;, or as I did, gave write access to \u0026ldquo;/var/www\u0026rdquo;, and create (ln -s . download) a symbolic link for download.\nSo\u0026hellip; let\u0026rsquo;s create a first package:\nWe must login into OCS Web interface, and select (first menu option on first yellow icon) package creation We must assign a name for the package, Platform, Protocol and Priority (priority will allow us to decide package execution order in the client, the lower number, the higher priority) If we\u0026rsquo;re going to upload files, we must ZIP it BEFORE, so OCS will unzip on client machine, and then run commands We choose an action, and then, a path (we can use system variables like %SYSTEMDRIVE%, %TEMP%, %USERPROFILE%, %PROGRAMFILES%, etc) to store the file, or command to run We can choose if we want the user to be warned about package execution, and even to allow user to delay execution (useful for service pack deployments, etc) Next step, will allow us to specify fragments (pieces in which the package will be split for allowing better deployment, making use of re-downloading for only failed fragments, etc), as well as checksum for data validity\nYour package, will be created then on /var/www/download/#pkgid#.\nActivating a package Once a package has been defined, we have an \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; file, describing package actions, and package fragments, we can have them together or split it between different servers, and we will have to specify where is located each piece, before using it on our machines. That process is called \u0026ldquo;Activation\u0026rdquo;.\nWhen we select that option, we have to specify the pkgid, so we use the second menu entry in the package deployment icon, and we\u0026rsquo;ll get a list of packages ready for activation, and then, we select \u0026ldquo;Activate\u0026rdquo; from the one we\u0026rsquo;re interested in.\nOn package activation, we will be asked for two SERVERS (thanks to the development team, specially to Pascal who helped in determining that we require to specify server name, not URL) one with https (for downloading info file) and one with http for downloading fragments (if any).\nAfter sending server names, OCS will check availability of \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; and fragment files (if any (On RUN packages, there is nothing to download prior to running the commands) and then, package will be activated and ready for next step.\nAffecting a package In this step, we can select a computer in the main view, or do a search using specific criteria, and as a result, apply a package on listed computers.\nWe can affect a package to several computers at once, just to one, and even, have different packages affect to the same computer\u0026hellip;.\nOCS will connect, and execute actions defined in priority order\u0026hellip;\nHow to get client side Package working Packages from client side, are as easy to setup, as having a working OCS Agent Service installed and a file called cacert.pem, which we got from the SSL Creation step\u0026hellip; having them in the OCS Agent folder, and a package affected to a computer, will make computer to download, and do the actions specified. ¿What are the pro\u0026rsquo;s and con\u0026rsquo;s of this method?\nWhen installing OCSAgent, using: OCSAgentSetup.exe /S /SERVER:yourserver.no-ip.org, we have no cacert.pem file copied, so we must copy it by hand, or, as I did, use an install script which does this in one step.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used NSIS to create a script for doing this:\nFirst, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to create a folder and put in it:\nOcsAgentSetup.exe cacert.pem NSIS Script service.ini (in my case, for accelerating first inventory creation) The file service.ini could look like this:\n#!ini [OCS_SERVICE] TTO_WAIT=10 PROLOG_FREQ=1 OLD_PROLOG_FREQ=1 Miscellaneous= /S /SERVER:yourserver.no-ip.org And NSIS script with:\n#!bat ; Script edited using HM NIS Edit Script Wizard. ; Creator Pablo Iranzo Gómez (Pablo.Iranzo@uv.es) ; Homepage: http://Alufis35.uv.es/~iranzo/ ; License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ ; HM NIS Edit Wizard helper defines !define PRODUCT_NAME \u0026#34;OCS\u0026#34; !define PRODUCT_VERSION \u0026#34;RC3\u0026#34; !define PRODUCT_PUBLISHER \u0026#34;Pablo Iranzo Gomez (Pablo.Iranzo@uv.es)\u0026#34; !define PRODUCT_WEB_SITE \u0026#34;http://Alufis35.uv.es/~iranzo/\u0026#34; SetCompressor zlib Name \u0026#34;${PRODUCT_NAME} ${PRODUCT_VERSION}\u0026#34; OutFile \u0026#34;ocs-inst.exe\u0026#34; InstallDir \u0026#34;$TEMP\u0026#34; Icon \u0026#34;${NSISDIR}ContribGraphicsIconsmodern-install.ico\u0026#34; SilentInstall silent InstallDirRegKey HKLM \u0026#34;${PRODUCT_DIR_REGKEY}\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026#34; Section \u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34; SEC01 SetOverwrite on SetOutPath \u0026#34;$TEMP\u0026#34; File \u0026#34;OcsAgentSetup.exe\u0026#34; Exec \u0026#34;$TEMPOcsAgentSetup.exe /S /SERVER:yourserver.no-ip.org\u0026#34; Exec \u0026#34;$PROGRAMFILESOCS Inventory AgentOCSService.exe -stop\u0026#34; SetOutPath \u0026#34;$PROGRAMFILESOCS Inventory Agent\u0026#34; File \u0026#34;cacert.pem\u0026#34; File \u0026#34;service.ini\u0026#34; Exec \u0026#34;$PROGRAMFILESOCS Inventory AgentOCSService.exe -start\u0026#34; Exec \u0026#34;$PROGRAMFILESOCS Inventory AgentOCSInventory.exe /SERVER:yourserver.no-ip.org /DEBUG\u0026#34; SectionEnd Section -Post SectionEnd` This script, when compiled, will create a ocs-inst.exe file, with all files needed to be packed in it, when executed, will:\nsilently run extract OCSAgentSetup install it using silent install then, stop service output cacert.pem certificate in OCS Service folder replace service.ini for faster inventory, and then, start service Force DEBUG and hand-started inventory This will leave us with a working OCS Agent Setup, with a valid certificate for authenticating against our deployment server, and ready for creating more packages.\nI hope this document is good for you to test this excellent software.\nThanks (again) to the OCS Developing team (specially to Pascal Danek) for creating such a nice program, and helping in diagnosing problems found and setup procedures for correctly using it.\nThanks to Pablo Chamorro for reviewing this article too ;)\nHave a look at OCS Deployment Tips and tricks to get ideas on how to use package deployment Enjoy!

To do so, we decided to use the vpnd daemon to establish links between our networks for allowing transparent traffic flow.\nThe vpnd it\u0026rsquo;s great because it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to configure and works fine, but has a little big problem\u0026hellip; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow to use DNS names for establishing VPN\u0026rsquo;s, it just allows to use static IP\u0026rsquo;s. Probably that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a problem for big business, universities, etc but as wireless projects are common between particulars, and at least in Spain we usually have dynamic IP\u0026rsquo;s, it made our tunnels to be \u0026ldquo;alive\u0026rdquo; until either our provider or the remote provider decides to change the IP\u0026hellip;\nAll of us were using Dynamic DNS Services from different providers (I use No-IP (http://www.no-ip.org), so if you decide to sign it with them, please use the following link No-Ip http://www.no-ip.com), other people at Valencia Wireless uses DynDNS http://www.dyndns.org, if in doubt, search for Dynamic DNS to get an idea on what you can use\u0026hellip;\nIn brief\u0026hellip; we had DNS names that get dynamically resolved to our current IP\u0026rsquo;s, but vpnd was unable to deal with those names\u0026hellip; so I wrote VPNS :-D\n(please, if you use it, send me an email to let me know how much people is using it\u0026hellip; thanks)\nRequirements VPNS, it\u0026rsquo;s just a bunch of configuration files and three scripts that requires the presence of:\nPerl (for the scripts) Bash or compatible (for the startup script) vpnd (for the VPN establishing) Ping (for resolving DNS names to IP\u0026rsquo;s) CAUTION\nAs this is just a gziped-tar file by the moment, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to check that the required software is installed before trying to use it.\nThis script has been created for a Debian GNU/Linux distribution, but as far as I can remember it\u0026rsquo;s compatible with the schema used on Red Hat, SuSE, etc\u0026hellip; but check before\nThe way it works\u0026hellip; As vpnd requires one key file (vpnd.key), and a configuration file (vpnd.conf) for each connection, the idea was to split different files for each node.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll require then one key file and one configuration file for each node to be able to spawn a vpnd daemon with those data.\nAs each vpnd will require both static origin and target IP\u0026rsquo;s there would be some things that would be static in the configuration (other parameters) and others that would need to get rewritten (target, and start addresses).\nConfiguration files The configuration get\u0026rsquo;s deployed on two directories: /etc/vpnd/ for the local host configuration (your host) and /etc/vpnd/hosts/* for the remote hosts configuration.\nThere are also some rc?.d directories with symbolic links to VPNS to start/stop the daemon at different runlevels, it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to copy them too, but as the main purpose of this script is to periodically test it, it should be included at crontab (as well as rc?.d to initial startup).\n4.1 Local Configuration Those files specify the configuration for the local host that will be used by all the other hosts.\n/etc/vpnd/master.resolv : In this file you\u0026rsquo;ll need to put the Dynamic DNS name of your machine (in my case \u0026ldquo;lacreu.no-ip.org\u0026rdquo;), so the update script will get your IP from it to be able to establish tunnels both if your IP changes or just if remote IP changes. /etc/vpnd/master.ip : This file is created automatically with the results of resolving your Dynamic DNS to an IP to allow comparison between your last IP and your current to check if you need to relaunch VPN\u0026rsquo;s (remember that the worst case is both local and remote IP\u0026rsquo;s getting changed). /etc/vpnd/master.restart : This file is created when local IP has changed, specifying a total vpnd restart for all VPN\u0026rsquo;s 4.2 Host configuration (/etc/vpnd/hosts/$HOST) Each file in this subdirectory specifies a VPN to be launched and defines the name that the configuration files would have appended.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll create a folder for each remote host with a descriptive name that would be use by the scripts.\nCAUTION\nFor creating the files you\u0026rsquo;ll have to use \u0026ldquo;echo \u0026ldquo;client\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt; mode\u0026rdquo; or similar (for port, resolv, mode, etc), there have been some problems with files not created this way (and my perl knowledge doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow me to do anything better).\nInto this subdirectory there would be the following config files:\n4.2.1 Static files vpnd.key : Cipher key that would be used for the connection with the remote host. It gets created by vpnd or copied from remote host. mode : Mode that we use to get connected to remote host (server or client) port : Port at which the connection gets established resolv : Dynamic DNS resolver name for the target host (used for resolving it\u0026rsquo;s IP) master : Master configuration file for HOST (the config that it\u0026rsquo;s static) 4.2.2 Dynamic files vpnd.conf : Configuration file for HOST, it gets created automatically when running /etc/vpnd/update.pl script restart : This file gets created by the \u0026ldquo;compare.pl\u0026rdquo; script to indicate that VPNS should restart this host VPN. This file is created if the IP has changed since last launch 4.2.3 Scripts /etc/vpnd/update.pl : Script to merge configuration files for host, resolve IP and then output a vpnd.conf file for that host /etc/vpnd/compare.pl : Script to compare IP\u0026rsquo;s between recorded one and current for preparing vpnd restart /etc/init.d/vpns : Script to start, stop, restart or restart-if-needed the VPNS based on hosts definitions Recommendations As probably IP\u0026rsquo;s will change, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to put a crontab sentence for checking of updated IP\u0026rsquo;s, to do so, put /etc/init.d/vpns restart-if-needed in your crontab for allowing the tunnels to be recreated at every change.\nSample crontab line would be:\n#!bash 0-59/5 * * * * root /etc/init.d/vpns restart-if-needed This way, every five minutes, the script would be run and will restart VPNS that needed to do so.\nAt every run, compare.pl will check new IP addresses, and will mark the service to be restarted, it will create master.ip and \u0026ldquo;host/ip\u0026rdquo; file.\nupdate.pl will dump a vpnd.conf file containing the merge of \u0026ldquo;host/master\u0026rdquo; and the Dynamic DNS for both local host and remote host configured as \u0026ldquo;host/mode\u0026rdquo; says using the \u0026ldquo;host/port\u0026rdquo; port to establish connection and vpnd.key file in each \u0026ldquo;host/\u0026rdquo; folder.\nChangelog Version 0.43 Added a check (chop $mode) with the mode definition to fix problems in systems that always configured mode as server (default check, because the if sentence at update.pl searched for \u0026ldquo;client\u0026rdquo; and sometimes it was not well compared)\nThanks to Hawkmoon\nVersion 0.42 Change in the compare.pl script for the case in which the changed ip was the local one to restart all VPN daemons.\nBefore this version, when local IP changed, only the first-checked VPN will be restarted as there was no file specifying a total restart.\nVersion 0.41 Little changes in configuration files an scripts to make it easier to set up, please, check your configuration files to use new behaviour\npidfile now gets automatically defined to match VPNS kill procedure, so it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be in \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; file. Version 0.4 Now, added localhost IP resolution to check if just origin or end (or both) changed their IP, so if either one of them changes, the VPN get\u0026rsquo;s marked as restart-needed.\nVersion 0.3 Each host is now restarted only if needed. (added VPNS restart-if-needed command) for not having to stop/relaunch every VPN at every time.\nAdded compare.pl script to compare IP\u0026rsquo;s and to let inform the VPNS that needs to restart it.\nVersion 0.2 Configuration files moved from /etc/vpnd/ to /etc/vpnd/hosts/*, so each host has it\u0026rsquo;s configuration files into one subdirectory, allowing to tidy the things a bit. Old files were named vpnd-HOST.conf, vpnd-HOST.key, HOST.resolv,etc. They got renamed and moved to the actual location.\nVersion 0.1 First version: at every restart of VPNS new configuration files were created for each host, and then the vpnd were restarted with the configuration files\nSample configuration files Here you will see a sample files used at my host, the other files not dumped here are created automatically by the scripts or you must create them manually (for example the vpnd.key).\n7.1 Local 7.1.1 master.resolv merak.no-ip.org\n7.2 Remote Host 7.2.1 mode server\n7.2.2 port 2010\n7.2.3 resolv oceano.dyndns.org\n7.2.4 master key value local 172.16.97.78 remote 172.16.97.77 autoroute keepalive 10 noanswer 3 keyfile vpnd.key` randomdev /dev/urandom mtu 1600 7.3 Sample run for Oceano (resulting vpnd.conf) key value local 172.16.97.78 remote 172.16.97.77 autoroute keepalive 10 noanswer 3 keyfile vpnd.key pidfile /var/run/vpnd:hawkmoon.pid randomdev /dev/urandom mtu 1600 client 81.202.20.245 2010 server 81.202.117.88 2010 mode server FAQ 8.1 Problems 8.1.1 Gentoo (Thanks to Hawkmoon) It seems that the script as provided within this package doesn\u0026rsquo;t work fine with Gentoo, please, specify the full path to the vpnd.key file in each \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; configuration file, and be sure to edit \u0026ldquo;VPNS\u0026rdquo; to point to your \u0026ldquo;vpnd\u0026rdquo; executable.\nCredits Copyright (c) 2003 Pablo Iranzo Gómez (Pablo.Iranzo@uv.es) https://Alufis35.uv.es/~iranzo/\nYou\u0026rsquo;re given permission to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU General Public License Version 2 or higher published by the Free Software Foundation\nPlease, if you use this program, email me to know where it gets to and if it\u0026rsquo;s used.\nAbout This document has been created using the LyX Editor and compiled with under Debian GNU/Linux, and then converted to the format you\u0026rsquo;re viewing.\nFile translated from TeX by T~T~H, version 3.67.
