      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some years ago I started using geo replication to keep a copy of all the pictures, docs, etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being using BitTorrent sync and later resilio sync (even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t fully liked the idea of it being not open source), I gave up. My NAS with 16 GB of ram, even if a bit older (HP N54L), seemed not to have enough memory to run it, and was constantly swapping.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>duplicity for managing backups</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I was checking a friend&amp;rsquo;s system for backing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was based on &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; at the Linux side and &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; server on a windows machine he uses for storing information generated by other software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution with &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; worked pretty well for him until he started to put several strange characters in filenames which rendered the backup unusable to certain point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being asked for alternative backup software that was available on several platforms, I&amp;rsquo;ve ended testing duplicity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
