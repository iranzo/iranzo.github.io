      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write about my experience (before I forget about it), and as some colleagues asked about it&amp;hellip; here we go&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As published in the blog entry &lt;a href=&#34;../../blog/2021/09/11/book-red-hat-enterprise-linux-8-administration/&#34;&gt;RHEL8 Administration book&lt;/a&gt;, some colleagues and I wrote a book on RHEL8 administration, which can be bought &lt;a href=&#34;https://s.iranzo.io/rhel8&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago I started one about Linux, but every time a new paragraph was added, a lot of new &amp;lsquo;TO-DO&amp;rsquo; items were appended as the information growth&amp;hellip; and as it was a &amp;lsquo;solo&amp;rsquo; project, I had other stuff to work on and was parked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
