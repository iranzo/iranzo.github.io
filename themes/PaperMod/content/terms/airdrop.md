An airdrop is a campaign that usually requires several social media steps like:

- Telegram group or channel follow
- Twitter actions such as like and retweet plus tag friends
- submit a form with some data.
- etc.

In exchange, your address is added to a list that later is validated to check if all the requirements are satisfied to receive some free [tokens]({{< ref "token.md" >}}).

Some airdrops have as prerequisites being owner of another cryptocurrency or to perform additional steps like community activity in the chats, etc.
