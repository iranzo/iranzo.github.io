A testnet is a phase of a project where a set of software nodes can help on the network to validate the conceptual ideas and practical operations.

By participating in a testnet via resources ([VPS]({{< ref "vps.md" >}}) servers, etc), the participants might get some tokens or criptocurrencies in exchange, allowing them to become early investors without actually paying for the tokens.
