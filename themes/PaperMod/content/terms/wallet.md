A wallet is a place to hold tokens, it might be online at an [exchange]({{< ref "exchange.md" >}}), at your browser like [metamask]({{< ref "metamask.md" >}}) or a piece of software running on your computer or mobile phone.

A wallet has an address and it's protected by a [seed phrase]({{< ref "seed.md" >}}) that is used to restore it on another device and usually by other methods like pin or passwords to protect it from misuse.

Each wallet is used on a network and others, allow several networks, providing different addresses on each one to receive the funds or cryptocurrencies.
