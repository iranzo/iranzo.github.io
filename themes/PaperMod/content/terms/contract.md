Contract address is the direction used for indicating in a specific network information about a crypto currency, for example:

| Currency | Network             | Contract                                     |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `BTCST`  | Binance Smart Chain | `0x78650B139471520656B9E7AA7A5E9276814A38E9` |
| `TRX`    | Binance Smart Chain | `0xf230b790E05390FC8295F4d3F60332c93BEd42e2` |
| `DAI`    | Ethereum            | `0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f` |

A given currency might have presence on different networks, so the contract on each one of them will be different.

Always pay real attention to the contract address, specially when adding it to your wallet to make sure you're not stolen by fake contracts.
