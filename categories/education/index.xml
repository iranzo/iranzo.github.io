      <description>&lt;p&gt;Telegram is being used frequently at schools for allowing an easy communication flow using the &amp;lsquo;channels&amp;rsquo;, where teachers can send information to families without sharing their personal contact details so that they can&amp;rsquo;t be contacted outside of the official tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comfort, came, probably because of not knowing the problems/dangers that were not taken into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For making it easier for parents to join the channel of the class, many times, public channels are created&amp;hellip; this allows to use a shorter &amp;lsquo;alias&amp;rsquo; but that everyone else can search and find&amp;hellip; and here is the problem&amp;hellip; &amp;rsquo;everyone&amp;rsquo; it&amp;rsquo;s not just parents or other teachers&amp;hellip; if you do the test by searching for &lt;code&gt;clase de&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;classe dels&lt;/code&gt; you&amp;rsquo;ll find lot of groups:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Red Hat has a program named Co.Lab which &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=co.lab&#34;&gt;provides kits&lt;/a&gt; under request that employees can use to guide a STEM session on schools to perform different range of activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed 2 sessions this year, one for the &amp;ldquo;We Are Red Hat Week&amp;rdquo; (&lt;code&gt;WARHW&lt;/code&gt;), which happens every year around Halloween, when the first official release was launched back in 31st October 1994 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/spooktacular-tale-red-hats-halloween-release&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Halloween Release&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the one at the office in Valencia, the range of ages was a bit wider so we did different kits and the parents were in charge of directing the lab for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
